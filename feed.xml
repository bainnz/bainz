                    <p><img src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/RaidouBuild-1.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Raidou Build Guide" /></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army, you have full control on how you want to build the protagonist: Raidou Kuzunoha XIV. I recently released a video on how I built him, from his chosen stat distribution, his weapon, his Active Combat Skills and his Passive Skills. I also went into the Demon Allies I chose, why I went with them and how I built them.</span></p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n4T8DtmHP90" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want a full in-depth explanation on those topics, <a href="https://youtu.be/n4T8DtmHP90" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch the build guide video</a>. In this post, I’ll be providing some of the relevant images, along with commentary on the main topics. Check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/bainz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Channel</a> for more SMT guides, boss fights and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stats</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To start out with, like some other SMT games, each time Raidou levels up, you are able to assign one point in either Strength, Magic, Vitality or Luck. Incenses, which you get throughout the game, can also increase either Raidou or his Demon’s stats.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/bainzRaidouStats-2.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouStats-2-xs.webp 300w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouStats-2-sm.webp 480w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouStats-2-md.webp 768w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouStats-2-lg.webp 1024w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are what the different stats in Raidou Remastered do:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strength: Increases Physical sword attacks and Combat Skills</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic: Increases Magic Combat Skills, Magic Defense, Stats of Ally Demons</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitality: Increases Physical Defense and Max HP</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luck: Increase Critical Chance, Ailment Resistance and Item Drop Rates</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my opinion, Magic is the priority in the early game due to it having triple benefits for your entire team. Vitality is a good option after you get a decent amount of Magic, to help live strong Physical attacks. Once Raidou is able to learn stronger Physical attacks, such as Heat Wave, you can consider adding some Strength points. Luck, due to only affecting the RNG elements, is a last priority for me.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weapons</span></h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/bainzRaidouSword.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouSword-xs.webp 300w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouSword-sm.webp 480w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouSword-md.webp 768w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouSword-lg.webp 1024w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main way to actually customize Raidou is through Sword Alchemy in the Goumaden. You can unlock more weapons for Raidou as the story progresses, in the form of swords, spears and axes. Swords offer standard balanced gameplay, spears are faster and good for the Combo Meter, while axes are slower but do more damage per hit. I found swords to be the most comfortable, so by late game, I stuck with a sword called Murakumo. But any weapon works, as long as they have the same base attack and bonus stats.</span></p>
<figure ><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/amenonuboko-2.png" alt="Ameno-Nuboko (Credit to Game8)" width="687" height="178" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/amenonuboko-2-xs.webp 300w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/amenonuboko-2-sm.webp 480w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/amenonuboko-2-md.webp 768w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/amenonuboko-2-lg.webp 1024w"></figure>
<figcaption >Ameno-Nuboko (Credit to <a href="https://game8.co/games/RAIDOU-Remastered/archives/531053" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game8</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In NG+ there is a spear called Ameno-Nuboko which has 410 base attack, making it best for Raidou in subsequent playthroughs.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Active Combat Skills</span></h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/bainzRaidouCombat.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouCombat-xs.webp 300w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouCombat-sm.webp 480w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouCombat-md.webp 768w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouCombat-lg.webp 1024w">
<figcaption >Heat Wave is another good option over Menacing Blade</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next are the 3 skills you can use in combat. There are a number of them in the game, but I actually stuck to 2 early ones for my entire playthrough. The first one being Magnetize from the Type-32 Gunto Axe, which restores 50% of your MAG. Because of how important MAG is for your Demon allies, this skill never left my build. The second one was Zeal from the Kiyotsune Axe, which cures your team’s status ailments and triggers ‘Zeal’ for the party. The effect of Zeal seems to provide a status immunity, and increase your team’s offense and defense during its 10 second duration. It has a longer cooldown of 30 seconds, but it’s the only team boosting skill Raidou gets, so I kept it my entire playthrough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last one was always kept to an attacking move, usually a Physical one, as I had Demon allies to hit enemy weaknesses. I liked using moves like Heat Wave and Menacing Blades, but there are a number of good options. Megidoloan is a nice Magic nuke, but its 60 second cooldown made me not use it much. In the end, try them all out and keep the move you like using the most.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passive Skills</span></h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/bainzRaidouPassives.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouPassives-xs.webp 300w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouPassives-sm.webp 480w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouPassives-md.webp 768w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouPassives-lg.webp 1024w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important parts of building Raidou are his passive skills. You get 6 to start out with, but can unlock 2 more from Case Files 30 and 42.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/bainzRaidouCaseFiles.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouCaseFiles-xs.webp 300w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouCaseFiles-sm.webp 480w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouCaseFiles-md.webp 768w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouCaseFiles-lg.webp 1024w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a ton of good options here, so I’ll just list the ones I chose for my final build:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summoner’s Will: Increases damage of Spirit Slashes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Righteous Heart (unlocked from Case File 42): Increases all sources of Spirit gain</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devil’s Ruin: Increases the damage of Devil’s Bane (Raidou’s counter)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martial Instinct: Slightly reduces the amount of time until Raidou’s combat skills can be used again (tested and found to be a 20% reduction)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shield Breaker: Greatly increases the damage allies deal to foe’s weakness shields</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diamond Disposition: Greatly increases the damage dealt by and MAG cost of Demon attacks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capricious Miracle: Provides a chance that Demon attacks do not consume MAG</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blessing of Mercury: Reduces Demon’s MAG consumption (20% reduction)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, this is a fairly offensive set-up, because those are the types of builds I tend to prefer. But if you find yourself taking more damage or dying, there are defensive passives like Vengeance Seal, Resist Phys, Resist Fire/Elec, Resist Ice/Force, Resist Mind/Death, Tiger/Dragon Stance, Phoenix/Tortoise-Snake Step and Inspiring Flash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some other passives I considered were Heroic Poise, which increases the damage of sword attacks at full HP, Merciless Strikes, which increases damage dealt to stunned enemies, and Summoner’s Rebirth, which restores 20% of damage taken as MAG. Most of the passives I have mentioned are naturally unlocked pretty late, as they’re the best ones in the game. In early game, I used ones like MAG Drainer, Combo Rondo, Devil’s Trick and Phoenix Step.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demons</span></h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/bainzRaidouThoth1.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouThoth1-xs.webp 300w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouThoth1-sm.webp 480w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouThoth1-md.webp 768w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouThoth1-lg.webp 1024w"></figure>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/bainzRaidouThoth2-2.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouThoth2-2-xs.webp 300w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouThoth2-2-sm.webp 480w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouThoth2-2-md.webp 768w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouThoth2-2-lg.webp 1024w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something else I wanted to include in this post were the main Demons I ended up using. Every Demon skill in Raidou is transferable, meaning there isn’t much separating Demons gameplay wise, in fact only their base resistances offer much reason to use one over another. The Demon that actually has the best resistances is Thoth, a Level 38 Demon that has better resistances than even Level 70 ones. 5 immunities at Level 38 is insane, and they come at a time when you can get Resist Phys easily from Hayatoro. I made this Demon into my main buffer and healer, they were given all the temporary duration buffs. The passive Skill Extension increases the duration of buffs cast and Magic Boost reduces MAG consumption.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/bainzRaidouBlackFrost1.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouBlackFrost1-xs.webp 300w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouBlackFrost1-sm.webp 480w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouBlackFrost1-md.webp 768w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouBlackFrost1-lg.webp 1024w"></figure>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/bainzRaidouBlackFrost2.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouBlackFrost2-xs.webp 300w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouBlackFrost2-sm.webp 480w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouBlackFrost2-md.webp 768w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouBlackFrost2-lg.webp 1024w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other Demon I ran was usually an Elemental attacker who could stun enemies and had the other buffing skills I was missing on Thoth. I chose Black Frost for this role because they’re my favorite SMT Demon, showing that anyone can be used for this role. Black Frost has the buffs that last the entire fight, so the rest of the time they could use MAG for attacking skills. I did use the DLC passives that boosted damage such as Mage’s Craft and Destructive Joy, but many other passives work here. With just these two Demons I had every single buff active with full uptime, healing and plenty of damage, so I stuck with this set-up for my playthrough.</span></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/bainzRaidouMain.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouMain-xs.webp 300w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouMain-sm.webp 480w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouMain-md.webp 768w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/bainzRaidouMain-lg.webp 1024w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that was my guide on building Raidou, with a small tangent on my Demon allies. In this game, there’s not really one optimal build, this was mainly to show what I used and what options there are. Last thing to mention, in NG+, you are able to unlock 4 new Passive skills.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/ngpluspassives.png" alt="" width="1041" height="103" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/ngpluspassives-xs.webp 300w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/ngpluspassives-sm.webp 480w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/ngpluspassives-md.webp 768w ,https://bainz.ca/media/posts/14/responsive/ngpluspassives-lg.webp 1024w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I haven’t played NG+ yet, but all these skills sound good, particularly Goddess Lullaby depending on how good the MAG restoration is. But for this post, I wanted to keep things limited to a NG playthrough. Let me know if you liked this post by viewing my guide video and sharing the post/video for other players! Thank you for reading.</span></p>

<p class="graf graf--p">It’s no surprise that the Persona that’s locked to NG+ is the strongest in the game.

This build is centered around abusing technicals by applying Dizzy, then following up with Morning Star to break boss shields and do a lot of damage. Dizzy is the ailment used because bosses are susceptible to it, and if an opponent is inflicted, any attack on them becomes a technical. Only the Final Boss and the first phase of the Osaka Jail boss are immune to Dizzy, for every other one you can apply the ailment and start comboing them with Morning Star.</p>

<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Alice</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8v8axXcW_acWEMvfcDHzOQ.png" data-image-id="1*8v8axXcW_acWEMvfcDHzOQ.png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Alice is essentially the best trash mob clearer in the game. As long as a non-boss opponent doesn’t block/resist Curse, they can quickly be taken out with Die for Me. I also added Maeigaon and Curse Boost/Amp, just in case Insta-Kills don’t work in certain situations. I normally start battles with Alice equipped, as she clears dungeons the fastest, so I put Attack/Speed Master on her to always start out with those buffs, without having to continually swap Personas. Alice’s combo skills of Concentrate, Mamudoon and Megidolaon are also some of the best in general.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Metatron</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7Dx4xlZrCcu0RTGdQXSseA.png" data-image-id="1*7Dx4xlZrCcu0RTGdQXSseA.png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Metatron is the Bless-based counterpart to Alice, which is why I gave him Mahamaon, to deal with any enemies that block Curse insta-kills. Mahamaon has a lower chance for insta-kill than Die for Me, but it has a much wider range, making Metatron just as good for dungeon clearing. I kept Sword Dance and added Knockdown Style (Greatly decreases Down Gauge when landing a critical hit) just for when I felt like using the Physical skill instead of magic ones.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Yoshitsune</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UHTmlwHyKGAKl5Qi4MlWRQ.png" data-image-id="1*UHTmlwHyKGAKl5Qi4MlWRQ.png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">One of the strongest Personas from previous games returns, and is no disappointment. Yoshitsune’s Hassou Tobi continues to be a very good skill (though it’s not the strongest anymore, see the damage video I did below), and can be used to clear both mobs and bosses. This build is centered around applying Shock with Wild Thunder (most bosses are still susceptible to it), which allows for Phys skills like Hassou Tobi to become a technical, letting it easily break shields and hit for more damage. Yoshitsune can’t inherit Magic skills, so I had to use a skill card for Wild Thunder, but even Zio could be used in that slot as it’s being used for the ailment more so than damage. If an Elec skill card can’t be found, Freeze or Dizzy can work in place of Shock. Salvation is on here to quickly heal (Hassou Tobi costs 30% HP) without having to swap Personas, but it could be replaced by just Diarahan or the healing skill could be on a separate Persona.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Black Frost</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xsRqXwqkvFfJ5ajcsuFmbA.png" data-image-id="1*xsRqXwqkvFfJ5ajcsuFmbA.png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Black Frost’s build is based around the same idea as Yoshitsune, just with applying Freeze and following up with a strong Phys skill. Agneyastra is actually the highest damage Phys move in the game, above even Hassou Tobi (see damage vid below).</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Arsene</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VmRdtP6onir0eZg1gshj3w.png" data-image-id="1*VmRdtP6onir0eZg1gshj3w.png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Have to keep the starter around and I stuck with the same build for Arsene as Lucifer, because Dizzy+Almighty can be used to beat almost every boss. This type of build is of course better on Lucifer, because Morning Star does about 50% more damage than Megidolaon, but I still tend to use Arsene more often. The remaining skills slots are taken up by Debilitate and Heat Riser, which are some of the best skills in the game and can be put on any Persona. Arsene actually has a full skill tree for once, learning Maeigaon and Riot Gun at later levels, so a Curse or Gun Build could also work for him.</p>

</figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Two things might be noticeable for these Personas. One is that most have a weakness or two which isn’t patched up, the reason being that you can often keep a boss permanently staggered by hitting their weakness or a technical, giving them little opportunity to target you, so your own weak point doesn’t matter as much. But if you find yourself getting hit and knocked down many times, Resist/Null skills can be added in place of other ones.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The second thing is the lack of Charge/Concentrate. In previous Personas, using those skills was a no brainer because it resulted in the next turn’s attack doing 2.5x damage. In Strikers, using Charge/Conc has the same effect, but due to the action style of the game, taking time to use those skills can feel unnecessary. The timer of how long an enemy is inflicted with an ailment continues to go down when casting Charge/Conc, so it often seems better to attack as many times as possible during that window, instead of powering up for one stronger attack. It’s basically personal preference, but I rarely feel the need to use those skills this time around.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Most builds on here center around ailments and capitalizing on them, so they’re most effective with a high Luck stat and the Bond skill ‘Luck Boost’ levelled as high as possible. Ailments and insta-kills will feel a lot weaker otherwise.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">As can be seen by Arsene, any Persona can be usable if you invest stats into them. Some other good Personas, based on their element, what skills they learn and what combos they have:</p>

<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Trumpeter</h4>

<p>Trumpeter naturally learns Debilitate and Heat Riser, and Rank 10 of Margaret’s S. Link requires showing her a Trumpeter with Mind Charge. Given this, he’s basically the de facto Support Persona in P4G. It helps that you only need 3 skills to make him invincible to everything but Almighty.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Helel</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uYq-jzi-CWbrDwkwr3vMQA.png" data-image-id="1*uYq-jzi-CWbrDwkwr3vMQA.png" data-width="1378" data-height="773" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Morning Star is the best Almighty move and exclusive to Helel. Almighty magic isn’t as strong as other elements due to no Boost/Amp in P4G, but in exchange it can never be blocked/resisted.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Izanagi</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Q8SacHHgmx2b2wF4ApjJcg.png" data-image-id="1*Q8SacHHgmx2b2wF4ApjJcg.png" data-width="1378" data-height="773" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">As with other Persona games, I like keeping the starter around to the end. For Izanagi, I went with Maziodyne and Primal Force as the skills. Maziodyne cause Electric is Izanagi’s thing, and Primal Force cause even though it’s weaker than Hassou Tobi, it has a much higher crit rate.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Since traits are new, and the game has not been out very long, there are a few misunderstandings on how certain traits really work. Since you’re not able to change a trait after fusion, it’s pretty important to know how it actually works, because you don’t want to spend time maxing out stats on a Persona whose trait doesn’t function how you think it does. I wanted to make this post to clear some misconceptions, and I’ll keep it updated as I’m able to test more myself.</p>

<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Are all traits transferable?</h4>
<p class="graf graf--p">All traits can be passed on, except for DLC Persona traits.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">What is the chance rate of party member traits activating?</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pFRCZfkm6Ig2fAjH9lz8LA.jpeg" data-image-id="1*pFRCZfkm6Ig2fAjH9lz8LA.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Some party members have traits that do not activate every time, and are instead chance based, such as Ryuji, Ann and Akechi. I tested how often their traits activated during Velvet Room challenge battles. Ryuji’s trait Raging Temper activated 12/60 times and Ann’s trait Mastery of Magic activated 6/30 times, so fair to say the chance rate on their traits is ~20%. Akechi’s trait Tactical Spirit (Chance to halve Support skill costs for all allies) activated 29/50 times, so his seems to activate at a ~60% rate.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Also, Izanagi has a trait named ‘God Maker’, which increases the chance of ally traits activating. When equipping Izanagi, Raging Temper activated 36/61 times, almost 60%, which means that God Maker seems to triple the chances of ally traits working. Tactical Spirit, with God Maker equipped, activated every time.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Does Pagan Allure exceed the damage cap?</h4>
<p class="graf graf--p">One of the biggest causes of confusion seems to be Satanael’s original trait, Pagan Allure, whose in-game description reads, “Strengthens magic skills by 50%”. Before going further, it’s important to know how damage boosting works in P5. All damage boosts are multiplicative, so if you have something like Boost+Amp+Magic Ability, you would expect to have 2.34x damage (1.25*1.5*1.25). However, there is a damage cap that restricts damage boosting to 100%, meaning those 3 skills would at most give you a 2x damage buff.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The JP wiki upon release stated that Satanael’s trait does not exceed the 100% damage cap, so if you already have something like Boost+Amp+Magic Ability, Pagan Allure will not add any damage on top of that. Satanael’s trait was the only one mentioned that could not exceed the damage cap, while other traits such as Mighty Gaze/Intense Focus (Strengthen multi-target or single target magic by 20%) could.</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BU2rzFARF-o" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Luckily, SodiumCat was able to test this out recently and posted their results on Youtube, I’d recommend watching the video to see for yourself.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The TLDW is that yes, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pagan Allure does not exceed the damage cap</strong>, so if you already have Boost+Amp+Magic Ability you will not see any extra damage due to Pagan Allure. However, Mighty Gaze/Intense Focus/Will of the Sword do exceed the cap, so if you are making a Magic-based Persona, those traits would be better. Satanael’s trait seems to be the only one that has this damage cap restriction.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It should be noted here that although Satanael’s trait doesn’t exceed the damage cap, his exclusive skill Tyrant’s Mind (1.25x boost to all attacks) can.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">How does Will of the Sword work?</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TbwP08DUSrJoOzqdTrLwMA.jpeg" data-image-id="1*TbwP08DUSrJoOzqdTrLwMA.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Another trait that has led to some confusion is Will of the Sword. Its in-game description reads, “Triples the effect of Charge/Concentrate.” Charge/Concentrate regularly make the next attack do 2.5x damage, so there was a question of whether Will of the Sword changes the multiplier to 3x or if it triples the effectiveness of Charge itself, causing the next attack to do 7.5x damage (3 * 2.5).</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*H1JcQKp3YFBz6Iy7QTihqQ.jpeg" data-image-id="1*H1JcQKp3YFBz6Iy7QTihqQ.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<figcaption class="imageCaption">Brave Blade</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">I went about testing it with Futsunushi. Brave Blade with no Charge did 2693 damage on avg, while Charged Brave Blade did 8039 damage on avg. So Charge multiplied the attack by 3x, not 7.5x. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">This means Will of the Sword gives an effective 20% damage boost (3 / 2.5).</strong></p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Lemc5e3MkOJqFjmYD0f9kA.jpeg" data-image-id="1*Lemc5e3MkOJqFjmYD0f9kA.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<figcaption class="imageCaption">Charged Brave Blade with Will of the Sword (~3x dmg)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">The second question is, does Will of the Sword need to be on the Persona who attacks or the buffer? To test this, I put Charge on Will of the Sword Futsunushi. Then looked at a different Persona, Siegfried, with a completely separate trait.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Siegfried when using Brave Blade did 2705 damage normally. When I used Charge on Futsunushi, then switched to Siegfried to attack, the damage was 6665. The Charge multiplier here was ~2.5x, meaning <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Will of the Sword only works when it is on the attacker, not the buffing Persona</strong>.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">That last thing is the weird bug with this trait. If you start a battle with a Will of the Sword Persona equipped, you will automatically have a free Concentrate on you. This was noted on the JP wiki as well. There’s nothing in the trait description that mentions this, so it can only be assumed to be a bug.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Do Striking Weight or Undying Fury affect Gun skills?</h4>
<p class="graf graf--p">Striking Weight and Undying Fury increase the damage of Phys skills by 20% or 30%. Since Gun skills are affected by Charge, it might have been the case that they would be affected by these traits. But no, if you use a gun skill with either of these traits, an activation message doesn’t show up in-game and there isn’t a damage difference.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">What are the best transferable damage boosting traits?</h4>
<p class="graf graf--p">Since we now know that Pagan Allure cannot exceed the damage cap, and that Will of the Sword gives a 3x boost not a 7.5x one, we can get a better idea of what the best transferable damage raising traits are. For boss fights:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">On Phys attackers, it would be Undying Fury (Strengthens Phys attacks by 30%, Zaou-Gongen).</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">On Gun attackers, it would be Will of the Sword (Futsunushi).</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">On Magic attackers, it would be Mighty Gaze, Intense Focus or Will of the Sword. Mighty Gaze/Intense Focus always give you +20%, but you have to choose between single and multi-target skills. Will of the Sword’s 20% boost only comes when concentrated, but allows for any type of skill to get the damage boost.</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Since bosses are generally not susceptible to ailments, weakness hits or criticals, the guaranteed flat damage boost from the above traits would be best for those. For common enemies or Velvet Room challenges, there are other options such as:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Ailment Hunter: Raises damage dealt by 25% for each foe afflicted with an ailment</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Universal Law: Strengthens technical damage by 50% (Kohryu)</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Relentless: Strengthens attacks that strike foe weaknesses by 50% (this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKSIxAwnfUE" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKSIxAwnfUE" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only works with single-target skills</a>)</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Linked Bloodline: Greatly increases damage after a Baton Pass (Cybele, some testing shows this trait only affects single-target skills after a Baton Pass, and the boost is 40%)</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">How good is Country Maker?</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aSTPqfefozgsoh4RZqqx4A.jpeg" data-image-id="1*aSTPqfefozgsoh4RZqqx4A.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">One of the new DLC Personas, Izanagi-no-Okami, has an exclusive trait called Country Maker, which “Increases Attack/Defense based on Inmate Registry completion.” The question is, how much of a damage/defense buff does it give, when compendium completion is 100%? As of right now, I have 91% Compendium completion, but that should be enough to see how much of a benefit Country Maker gives.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IvqJagpDw-vXDknOMyRJig.jpeg" data-image-id="1*IvqJagpDw-vXDknOMyRJig.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">For the Attack part, it can be tested by using a gun attack while Izanagi-nO is equipped, then equipping a different Persona with the same Str stat, doing the same attack and comparing the damage. A gun attack with Izanagi-nO equipped did 66 damage on avg, when equipping a different Persona, it did 34 damage on avg. This is a 1.94x damage boost, and considering I still have some space to fill in the compendium, it seems that Country Maker does indeed give a 100% damage boost to attacks at full capacity (and this can stack with other passives such as Boost/Amp/Magic Ability).</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5lpiXrMzkns3md7BCcWsAQ.jpeg" data-image-id="1*5lpiXrMzkns3md7BCcWsAQ.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Defense can be looked at the same way. With Izanagi-nO equipped, Blazing Hell during a Velvet Room challenge did 50 damage on avg. Izanagi-nO has a resistance to fire and had the Firm Stance skill on him, so if neither of those were there, it would have done 200 damage.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fB5tOWQdRRogfG5Mkbc90g.jpeg" data-image-id="1*fB5tOWQdRRogfG5Mkbc90g.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">On another Persona, with the same En stat but no Firm Stance and no resistance to fire, Blazing Hell did 360 damage on avg. So it seems Country Maker reduced damage taken here by 45% (1 - 200/360). Considering I currently have 91% compendium completion, it makes sense to draw the conclusion that Country Maker reduces damage taken by half when the compendium is fully completed.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">So in conclusion, with full compendium, Country Maker doubles your damage and reduces damage taken by half.</strong></p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Does Inviolable Beauty work with Repel Phys?</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZSj9A2Ao-2KvV6vW7SlZOQ.jpeg" data-image-id="1*ZSj9A2Ao-2KvV6vW7SlZOQ.jpeg" data-width="680" data-height="383" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<figcaption class="imageCaption">Repel Phys without Inviolable Beauty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Kaguya naturally comes with a trait called Inviolable Beauty, whose description reads, “Triples damage dealt by Counter skills.” Because Kaguya learns both Counterstrike/High Counter and Repel Phys through level up, it was unclear whether Inviolable Beauty would work with Repel Phys, or if it only worked with designated ‘Counter’ skills.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k9np8gqwTm56tD_Ka0HIDA.jpeg" data-image-id="1*k9np8gqwTm56tD_Ka0HIDA.jpeg" data-width="680" data-height="383" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<figcaption class="imageCaption">Repel Phys with Inviolable Beauty (doing 3x damage)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Tested in the Velvet Room, Inviolable Beauty does in fact work with Repel Phys. Whether you reflect back damage using a counter skill or Repel Phys, it will do the same 3x damage back at the opponent.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">What is the difference between Wealth of Lotus and Positive Thoughts?</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uqh8IJVaGJugBv8c2yjVlw.jpeg" data-image-id="1*uqh8IJVaGJugBv8c2yjVlw.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<figcaption class="imageCaption">Lakshmi</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Wealth of Lotus (Lakshmi) states it, “Increases effect period of support skills cast on allies by 2 turns”, while Positive Thoughts (Vohu Manah) states it, “Increases effect period of support skills cast on self by 2 turns.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">I tested both of these and found these results:</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Wealth of Lotus</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Extends buffs cast by Joker on himself by 2 turns</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Extends buffs cast by Joker to other party members by 2 turns</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Works with Auto-Ma skills to extend them by 2 turns for whole party</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Positive Thoughts</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Extends buffs cast by Joker on himself by 2 turns</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Extends buffs received to Joker from other party members by 2 turns</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Works with Auto-Ma skills to extend them by 2 turns for whole party</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Positive Thoughts <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">seems</em> like it should not work with Auto-Ma skills, because it normally does not extend buffs to allies, but I tested it and it works. Dunno if that was intended, or if it is a bug.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Does the Omen trait boost the chances of Thanatos’ Door Of Hades?</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*igUs7vieE51AMCuNisSg7A.jpeg" data-image-id="1*igUs7vieE51AMCuNisSg7A.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Thanatos’ exclusive skill is Door of Hades, whose description reads, “Heavy Almighty damage to all foes with medium chance of instant death.” Sandalphon’s original trait is Omen, which “Greatly increases the chance of insta-kills.” It would be interesting to look at if Omen boosts Door of Hades’ instant death chances.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Iqy6Gb2m5FKlfhFjP14Irg.jpeg" data-image-id="1*Iqy6Gb2m5FKlfhFjP14Irg.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">To test, I first used Door of Hades, with Thanatos’ original trait, on Nebiros in one of the Velvet Room challenges. Door of Hades resulted in an instant death 15/45 times (33%). I then re-fused Thanatos to put the Omen trait on him, and tested it out again with the new trait. Omen Door of Hades then resulted in an instant death 29/60 times (48%). <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Omen gave a ~1.5x boost to the chance of Door of Hades succeeding, so it’s definitely worth it to have on Thanatos.</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">One other thing that came out of this testing: the Alice in the Velvet Room challenge was programmed to block insta-deaths (Samsara was blocked on her). But both Nebiros and Belial could be taken out with Samsara, meaning they’re both vulnerable to insta-kills. However, during all the times I tried Door of Hades, it never worked on Belial. Then I saw later that Belial nulls curse skills. So from doing this, I think it confirms that Door of Hades deals Almighty damage, but it’s insta-death component is Curse-based. So perhaps Mudo Boost could also raise Door of Hades’ chances. And given that Nebiros resists curse, it’s likely that Omen Door of Hades has a higher chance rate than 48% against a curse neutral foe.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Would Foul Stench be useful with Raoul’s Phantom Show?</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tCgGdUHf-Qv1FLekAqby0Q.jpeg" data-image-id="1*tCgGdUHf-Qv1FLekAqby0Q.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<figcaption class="imageCaption">Foul Stench Raoul for testing</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Since Raoul’s exclusive skill is Phantom Show (High odds of sleep to all foes), it makes sense to try and increase the chances of it connecting as much as possible. The Foul Stench trait and Ailment Boost skill have the same in-game description, “Increases chance of inflicting ailments.” I wondered if there would be any difference between having both of these on Raoul, versus only having one.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">So I tested a Raoul with the Foul Stench trait + Ailment Boost skill, against one that only had Ailment Boost. With Foul Stench + Ailment Boost, Phantom Show connected 99/102 times (97%). With only Ailment Boost, Phantom Show actually connected more, 101/102 times (99%). Functionally the exact same hit rate, despite not having the Foul Stench trait. So it seems having both is not worth it if you are using Phantom Show, you can simply have Ailment Boost and choose another trait for Raoul.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you are making a separate Ailment Persona, Foul Stench+Ailment Boost could be useful for skills like Evil Smile/Wage War/etc., which have medium odds instead of the high odds of Phantom Show.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">As I’ve done for P5 and P4, I wanted to make a post about the different party members in the recent P3 remake: Persona 3 Reload. This post contains the builds I had on each teammate at the end of my first playthrough. These builds can of course be changed however you want, if there are some skills I got rid of, that you’d rather keep.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In the following video, I went over each character, what they do and my thoughts on them as party members (check out the rest of my YouTube too btw). While it does contain a tier list format, it was very much intended as just a way to discuss each character, rather than their specific placements.</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LxfFwMA7J3Q" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">In the above video, I probably did overrate/underrate some of the party members. I rated Yukari pretty highly simply because I found her to be the most convenient/comfortable Healer to use, but Ken has a lot of things going for him, so they can be fairly interchangeable. If I was making this list again, I’d probably move Koromaru up a tier, his combination of coverage moves, AoE Charge, Revolution, and (eventually) Masukukaja/Debilitate are way too good. The dog is OP.</p>

<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Yukari</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mWpnDuBF8vGX2guBowJIcw.png" alt="Yukari" data-image-id="1*mWpnDuBF8vGX2guBowJIcw.png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Yukari is your standard Healer: she heals, removes ailments, lowers enemy agility, and heals even more. The main draw for Yukari are her characteristics, which reduce her SP costs for healing by 50-75%. This lets you have basically infinite healing for Tartarus runs and boss fights. Do you need that much healing? Probably no, but it’s still nice to have sometimes. Yukari’s 2nd Theurgy is a full team Concentrate (2.3x Damage in Reload), allowing her to support the team even more. Magic isn’t as strong as Phys in P3R, but I’m not gonna complain about that type of support skill on a healer.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Diarahan on this build could be swapped out, as Yukari’s characteristic makes full team healing so cheap as it is. But there’s not really any good move to replace it with (I’m never using Wind Break or ailments tbh). So I was fine keeping it here.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Junpei</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ssev7tDrZVhqGoW-lcnY5g.png" data-image-id="1*ssev7tDrZVhqGoW-lcnY5g.png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Junpei is your Critical Hit specialist in P3R, with his Theurgy charging faster after landing a crit and his characteristic increasing his Critical Rate &amp; Damage. Junpei can benefit quite a bit from gear, so getting the Omega Drive accessory (available as a reward for saving the missing person in Tartarus Floor 177) or his Ultimate Weapon (Masakado’s Katana in the Antique Store) would be pretty good for him, providing Apt Pupil (2x Crit Rate). Another great mid-game accessory for Junpei are the Slash Bracers (Slash Boost) from the Antique Store.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">I didn’t keep Junpei’s Strike attack on this build (Gigantic Fist), as late game the damage on it isn’t impressive and I have MC/Akihiko/Aigis for Strike.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Akihiko</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TyL4kTVNM_jxwV_1hmlPNg.png" data-image-id="1*TyL4kTVNM_jxwV_1hmlPNg.png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Akihiko can be one of the most misunderstood characters in P3R, simply because the wording on his Theurgy condition is awful. In-game it states, “After strengthening himself, his fighting spirit rises”. This makes it seem like you have to use Aki to buff himself, but how it actually works is: whenever Aki’s turn begins, if he has any type of buff on him, his Theurgy charges faster. Any teamwide buff works for this, making Akihiko have one of the fastest charging Theurgies.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">His final characteristic Buff Amp doesn’t specify it’s value either, but it actually gives a 1.3x Boost to any type of buff. This means that when Akihiko has an Attack Buff, instead of the normal 1.4x Damage, he’ll do ~1.82x Damage.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">All this means Akihiko will be one of the highest damaging party members you have, and he works with either Phys or Magic. His support options of Atk Down/Agi Up aren’t the best out of the team, so he’s definitely not a must pick character, but he’s very solid.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The Double Ziggurat weapon (Strike Amp) and Strike Bracers accessory (Strike Boost) help his physical damage a lot. Don’t use Evil Gloves (his “Ultimate Weapon”) on Akihiko, if MC has a Persona with Auto-Mataru/Maraku/Masuku, that weapon does literally nothing. I did keep both the Single Target and AoE Electric skills on Akihiko, but one of them could be replaced with Shock Boost.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Mitsuru</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*33DX9tEWoAxdKM0YeowVUA.png" data-image-id="1*33DX9tEWoAxdKM0YeowVUA.png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>

<figcaption class="imageCaption">Episode Aigis</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Mitsuru is your main Magic damage dealer throughout the game. Because of how skewed Reload is in favor of Phys, Akihiko/Junpei/Aigis will generally out-damage her, but she has some other things going for her. The support skill of Rakunda/Marakunda lowering enemy defense is super nice to have, being a reliable way to increase your whole team’s damage by 40% in any situation.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Her characteristic increases the Critical Rate of the whole party on enemies inflicted with an ailment. If you use the “Assassin Website Note” (from Club Escapade in September) on the dorm PC, you can acquire the ability to put Distress on enemies automatically when you ambush them. This lets you have a decent crit rate boost in almost every random encounter. Ailments are pretty much never useful for bosses, so that aspect of Mitsuru’s kit definitely takes a hit in those situations.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For Mitsuru to do max damage late game, you’d want to have the Kokuseki Senjin weapon (Magic Ability) and Varna Bracers accessory (Ice Amp) from the Antique Store. On this build, I did remove Neuro Slash as it doesn’t do much damage. I kept Ice Break as many late game enemies block Ice, but it could be replaced with Freeze Boost.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In Episode Aigis, Mitsuru got Vorpal Blade, so she can actually be a Phys DPS with Slash/Crit gear. See my Episode Aigis ranking for more info.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Aigis</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tvtrYiaA3f0Hwi3_-CLQdQ.png" data-image-id="1*tvtrYiaA3f0Hwi3_-CLQdQ.png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Aigis is your go-to buffer and Pierce damage dealer in the game. She also gets Resist Phys, Enduring Soul, Insta-Heal and the highest base Endurance stat for any party member, making her very tanky. Aigis’ best armor has a Null Ailments passive, which is why I didn’t keep Insta-Heal on this build. Aigis is pretty straightforward, using Phys attacks charge her Theurgy, her characteristic increases the damage of said Phys attacks, and you have Atk/Def buffs available to use.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Koromaru</h4>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*X_kD06AysfxTp5JMWg34iw.png" data-image-id="1*X_kD06AysfxTp5JMWg34iw.png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Koromaru is simply one of the best party members in the game. As soon as you get him, Koro is able to use 2 Theurgies, with the 2nd one, Power Howling, being a full party Charge. This is, in my opinion, the strongest support move in the game, as Phys is so good in Reload, and it lets any party member do 2.3x more damage with their next Phys attack.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">He gets coverage options in Fire, Dark, Slash, Almighty, and you can even get a weapon in the mid-game (Hazakura in the Antique Store) that turns his basic attack to Wind affinity, letting him hit 4 weaknesses. Revolution boosts your whole team’s crit rate. Masukukaja and Debilitate come pretty far in, but they add a lot to Koro’s support skill set.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Last thing to note about Koro is, Getsu-ei is a lot stronger than Tempest Slash when you are close to a Full Moon. And since pretty much every relevant fight happens on a Full Moon day, it’s a lot better to keep. Also, it has higher crit rate (15% vs 8% base chance). In Episode Aigis, Getsu-Ei got removed, so just use Tempest Slash.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Ken</h4>

<p class="graf graf--p">Ken is your second Healer, and he does get a number of different moves in his kit. He gets Electric, Light and Pierce coverage moves, so he’s able to hit more weaknesses than most party members. I didn’t keep Vile Assault on this build, but you can still get Pierce knockdowns with Ken’s basic attack. Most of the time, I’d use MC/Aigis/Junpei for Pierce so I opted to keep more of Ken’s support skills. I didn’t keep Samarecarm either, as revive items are fairly accessible, so the skill slot felt better used on other stuff.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In Episode Aigis, Ken learnt some new Pierce moves, including Myriad Arrows. I found myself not using Heat Riser much (prefer full party buffs), so I kept the 2 Pierce moves this time.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Ken has screens for Tetrakarn and Makarkarn, and his 2nd Theurgy takes this one step further, fully healing and reviving all teammates, as well as providing 1 layer of each screen for everyone. This is a great Theurgy, and if you keep Ken below 50% SP, he can get it back really quickly (every 3 turns). I didn’t use Ken as much during the Journey, but in Episode Aigis with combat being more difficult, I appreciated his kit a lot more and used him a ton!</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">Metis</h4>

<p class="graf graf--p">The most broken character, aside from MC. Does a ton of damage, has Charge, 2 great Strike Theurgies, Wind/Ice coverage (I removed these on the final build cause I didn’t need them as much late game), Attack buff, no weaknesses, good characteristic, etc etc etc. Basically Journey Aigis and Shinji in one.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you got this far, thanks for reading! I’ll definitely be making more videos/posts for Persona 3 Reload, so be sure to check out my YouTube and some other posts I have linked here. Cheers.</p>
