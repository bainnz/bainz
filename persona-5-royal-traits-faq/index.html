Since you’re not able to change a trait after fusion, it’s pretty important to know how it actually works, because you don’t want to spend time maxing out stats on a Persona whose trait doesn’t function how you think it does. I wanted to make this post to clear some misconceptions, and I’ll keep it updated as I’m able to test more myself.</p><p class="graf graf--p">Related: <a href="https://medium.com/@bainz350/ultimate-persona-team-persona-5-royal-builds-1ec9f2fee2b5" data-href="https://medium.com/@bainz350/ultimate-persona-team-persona-5-royal-builds-1ec9f2fee2b5" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/@bainz350/ultimate-persona-team-persona-5-royal-builds-1ec9f2fee2b5"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Ultimate Persona Team (Persona 5 Royal Builds).</strong></a></p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body"><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 class="graf graf--h4">Are all traits transferable?</h4><p class="graf graf--p">All traits can be passed on, except for DLC Persona traits.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4">What is the chance rate of party member traits activating?</h4><figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pFRCZfkm6Ig2fAjH9lz8LA.jpeg" data-image-id="1*pFRCZfkm6Ig2fAjH9lz8LA.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure><p class="graf graf--p">Some party members have traits that do not activate every time, and are instead chance based, such as Ryuji, Ann and Akechi. I tested how often their traits activated during Velvet Room challenge battles. Ryuji’s trait Raging Temper activated 12/60 times and Ann’s trait Mastery of Magic activated 6/30 times, so fair to say the chance rate on their traits is ~20%. Akechi’s trait Tactical Spirit (Chance to halve Support skill costs for all allies) activated 29/50 times, so his seems to activate at a ~60% rate.</p><p class="graf graf--p">Also, Izanagi has a trait named ‘God Maker’, which increases the chance of ally traits activating. When equipping Izanagi, Raging Temper activated 36/61 times, almost 60%, which means that God Maker seems to triple the chances of ally traits working. Tactical Spirit, with God Maker equipped, activated every time.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4">Does Pagan Allure exceed the damage cap?</h4><p class="graf graf--p">One of the biggest causes of confusion seems to be Satanael’s original trait, Pagan Allure, whose in-game description reads, “Strengthens magic skills by 50%”. Before going further, it’s important to know how damage boosting works in P5. All damage boosts are multiplicative, so if you have something like Boost+Amp+Magic Ability, you would expect to have 2.34x damage (1.25*1.5*1.25). However, there is a damage cap that restricts damage boosting to 100%, meaning those 3 skills would at most give you a 2x damage buff.</p><p class="graf graf--p">The JP wiki upon release stated that Satanael’s trait does not exceed the 100% damage cap, so if you already have something like Boost+Amp+Magic Ability, Pagan Allure will not add any damage on top of that. Satanael’s trait was the only one mentioned that could not exceed the damage cap, while other traits such as Mighty Gaze/Intense Focus (Strengthen multi-target or single target magic by 20%) could.</p><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BU2rzFARF-o" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><p class="graf graf--p">Luckily, SodiumCat was able to test this out recently and posted their results on Youtube, I’d recommend watching the video to see for yourself.</p><p class="graf graf--p">The TLDW is that yes, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pagan Allure does not exceed the damage cap</strong>, so if you already have Boost+Amp+Magic Ability you will not see any extra damage due to Pagan Allure. However, Mighty Gaze/Intense Focus/Will of the Sword do exceed the cap, so if you are making a Magic-based Persona, those traits would be better. Satanael’s trait seems to be the only one that has this damage cap restriction.</p><p class="graf graf--p">It should be noted here that although Satanael’s trait doesn’t exceed the damage cap, his exclusive skill Tyrant’s Mind (1.25x boost to all attacks) can.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4">How does Will of the Sword work?</h4><figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TbwP08DUSrJoOzqdTrLwMA.jpeg" data-image-id="1*TbwP08DUSrJoOzqdTrLwMA.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure><p class="graf graf--p">Another trait that has led to some confusion is Will of the Sword. Its in-game description reads, “Triples the effect of Charge/Concentrate.” Charge/Concentrate regularly make the next attack do 2.5x damage, so there was a question of whether Will of the Sword changes the multiplier to 3x or if it triples the effectiveness of Charge itself, causing the next attack to do 7.5x damage (3 * 2.5).</p><figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*H1JcQKp3YFBz6Iy7QTihqQ.jpeg" data-image-id="1*H1JcQKp3YFBz6Iy7QTihqQ.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><figcaption class="imageCaption">Brave Blade</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p">I went about testing it with Futsunushi. Brave Blade with no Charge did 2693 damage on avg, while Charged Brave Blade did 8039 damage on avg. So Charge multiplied the attack by 3x, not 7.5x. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">This means Will of the Sword gives an effective 20% damage boost (3 / 2.5).</strong></p><figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Lemc5e3MkOJqFjmYD0f9kA.jpeg" data-image-id="1*Lemc5e3MkOJqFjmYD0f9kA.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><figcaption class="imageCaption">Charged Brave Blade with Will of the Sword (~3x dmg)</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p">The second question is, does Will of the Sword need to be on the Persona who attacks or the buffer? To test this, I put Charge on Will of the Sword Futsunushi. Then looked at a different Persona, Siegfried, with a completely separate trait.</p><p class="graf graf--p">Siegfried when using Brave Blade did 2705 damage normally. When I used Charge on Futsunushi, then switched to Siegfried to attack, the damage was 6665. The Charge multiplier here was ~2.5x, meaning <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Will of the Sword only works when it is on the attacker, not the buffing Persona</strong>.</p><p class="graf graf--p">That last thing is the weird bug with this trait. If you start a battle with a Will of the Sword Persona equipped, you will automatically have a free Concentrate on you. This was noted on the JP wiki as well. There’s nothing in the trait description that mentions this, so it can only be assumed to be a bug.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4">Do Striking Weight or Undying Fury affect Gun skills?</h4><p class="graf graf--p">Striking Weight and Undying Fury increase the damage of Phys skills by 20% or 30%. Since Gun skills are affected by Charge, it might have been the case that they would be affected by these traits. But no, if you use a gun skill with either of these traits, an activation message doesn’t show up in-game and there isn’t a damage difference.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4">What are the best transferable damage boosting traits?</h4><p class="graf graf--p">Since we now know that Pagan Allure cannot exceed the damage cap, and that Will of the Sword gives a 3x boost not a 7.5x one, we can get a better idea of what the best transferable damage raising traits are. For boss fights:</p><ul class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li">On Phys attackers, it would be Undying Fury (Strengthens Phys attacks by 30%, Zaou-Gongen).</li><li class="graf graf--li">On Gun attackers, it would be Will of the Sword (Futsunushi).</li><li class="graf graf--li">On Magic attackers, it would be Mighty Gaze, Intense Focus or Will of the Sword. Mighty Gaze/Intense Focus always give you +20%, but you have to choose between single and multi-target skills. Will of the Sword’s 20% boost only comes when concentrated, but allows for any type of skill to get the damage boost.</li></ul><p class="graf graf--p">Since bosses are generally not susceptible to ailments, weakness hits or criticals, the guaranteed flat damage boost from the above traits would be best for those. For common enemies or Velvet Room challenges, there are other options such as:</p><ul class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li">Ailment Hunter: Raises damage dealt by 25% for each foe afflicted with an ailment</li><li class="graf graf--li">Universal Law: Strengthens technical damage by 50% (Kohryu)</li><li class="graf graf--li">Relentless: Strengthens attacks that strike foe weaknesses by 50% (this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKSIxAwnfUE" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKSIxAwnfUE" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only works with single-target skills</a>)</li><li class="graf graf--li">Linked Bloodline: Greatly increases damage after a Baton Pass (Cybele, some testing shows this trait only affects single-target skills after a Baton Pass, and the boost is 40%)</li></ul><h4 class="graf graf--h4">How good is Country Maker?</h4><figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aSTPqfefozgsoh4RZqqx4A.jpeg" data-image-id="1*aSTPqfefozgsoh4RZqqx4A.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure><p class="graf graf--p">One of the new DLC Personas, Izanagi-no-Okami, has an exclusive trait called Country Maker, which “Increases Attack/Defense based on Inmate Registry completion.” The question is, how much of a damage/defense buff does it give, when compendium completion is 100%? As of right now, I have 91% Compendium completion, but that should be enough to see how much of a benefit Country Maker gives.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IvqJagpDw-vXDknOMyRJig.jpeg" data-image-id="1*IvqJagpDw-vXDknOMyRJig.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure><p class="graf graf--p">For the Attack part, it can be tested by using a gun attack while Izanagi-nO is equipped, then equipping a different Persona with the same Str stat, doing the same attack and comparing the damage. A gun attack with Izanagi-nO equipped did 66 damage on avg, when equipping a different Persona, it did 34 damage on avg. This is a 1.94x damage boost, and considering I still have some space to fill in the compendium, it seems that Country Maker does indeed give a 100% damage boost to attacks at full capacity (and this can stack with other passives such as Boost/Amp/Magic Ability).</p><figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5lpiXrMzkns3md7BCcWsAQ.jpeg" data-image-id="1*5lpiXrMzkns3md7BCcWsAQ.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure><p class="graf graf--p">Defense can be looked at the same way. With Izanagi-nO equipped, Blazing Hell during a Velvet Room challenge did 50 damage on avg. Izanagi-nO has a resistance to fire and had the Firm Stance skill on him, so if neither of those were there, it would have done 200 damage.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fB5tOWQdRRogfG5Mkbc90g.jpeg" data-image-id="1*fB5tOWQdRRogfG5Mkbc90g.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure><p class="graf graf--p">On another Persona, with the same En stat but no Firm Stance and no resistance to fire, Blazing Hell did 360 damage on avg. So it seems Country Maker reduced damage taken here by 45% (1 - 200/360). Considering I currently have 91% compendium completion, it makes sense to draw the conclusion that Country Maker reduces damage taken by half when the compendium is fully completed.</p><p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">So in conclusion, with full compendium, Country Maker doubles your damage and reduces damage taken by half.</strong></p><h4 class="graf graf--h4">Does Inviolable Beauty work with Repel Phys?</h4><figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZSj9A2Ao-2KvV6vW7SlZOQ.jpeg" data-image-id="1*ZSj9A2Ao-2KvV6vW7SlZOQ.jpeg" data-width="680" data-height="383" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><figcaption class="imageCaption">Repel Phys without Inviolable Beauty</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p">Kaguya naturally comes with a trait called Inviolable Beauty, whose description reads, “Triples damage dealt by Counter skills.” Because Kaguya learns both Counterstrike/High Counter and Repel Phys through level up, it was unclear whether Inviolable Beauty would work with Repel Phys, or if it only worked with designated ‘Counter’ skills.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k9np8gqwTm56tD_Ka0HIDA.jpeg" data-image-id="1*k9np8gqwTm56tD_Ka0HIDA.jpeg" data-width="680" data-height="383" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><figcaption class="imageCaption">Repel Phys with Inviolable Beauty (doing 3x damage)</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p">Tested in the Velvet Room, Inviolable Beauty does in fact work with Repel Phys.

Door of Hades resulted in an instant death 15/45 times (33%). I then re-fused Thanatos to put the Omen trait on him, and tested it out again with the new trait. Omen Door of Hades then resulted in an instant death 29/60 times (48%). <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Omen gave a ~1.5x boost to the chance of Door of Hades succeeding, so it’s definitely worth it to have on Thanatos.</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p">One other thing that came out of this testing: the Alice in the Velvet Room challenge was programmed to block insta-deaths (Samsara was blocked on her). But both Nebiros and Belial could be taken out with Samsara, meaning they’re both vulnerable to insta-kills. However, during all the times I tried Door of Hades, it never worked on Belial. Then I saw later that Belial nulls curse skills. So from doing this, I think it confirms that Door of Hades deals Almighty damage, but it’s insta-death component is Curse-based. So perhaps Mudo Boost could also raise Door of Hades’ chances. And given that Nebiros resists curse, it’s likely that Omen Door of Hades has a higher chance rate than 48% against a curse neutral foe.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4">Would Foul Stench be useful with Raoul’s Phantom Show?</h4><figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tCgGdUHf-Qv1FLekAqby0Q.jpeg" data-image-id="1*tCgGdUHf-Qv1FLekAqby0Q.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><figcaption class="imageCaption">Foul Stench Raoul for testing</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p">Since Raoul’s exclusive skill is Phantom Show (High odds of sleep to all foes), it makes sense to try and increase the chances of it connecting as much as possible. The Foul Stench trait and Ailment Boost skill have the same in-game description, “Increases chance of inflicting ailments.” I wondered if there would be any difference between having both of these on Raoul, versus only having one.</p><p class="graf graf--p">So I tested a Raoul with the Foul Stench trait + Ailment Boost skill, against one that only had Ailment Boost. With Foul Stench + Ailment Boost, Phantom Show connected 99/102 times (97%). With only Ailment Boost, Phantom Show actually connected more, 101/102 times (99%). Functionally the exact same hit rate, despite not having the Foul Stench trait. So it seems having both is not worth it if you are using Phantom Show, you can simply have Ailment Boost and choose another trait for Raoul.</p><p class="graf graf--p">If you are making a separate Ailment Persona, Foul Stench+Ailment Boost could be useful for skills like Evil Smile/Wage War/etc., which have medium odds instead of the high odds of Phantom Show.</p></div></div></section></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__footer__col"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://bainz.ca/tags/persona-5-royal/">Persona 5 Royal</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbainz.ca%2Fpersona-5-royal-traits-faq%2F" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://bainz.ca/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbainz.ca%2Fpersona-5-royal-traits-faq%2F&amp;via=bainnz&amp;text=Persona%205%20Royal%20Traits%20FAQ" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://bainz.ca/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Persona%205%20Royal%20Traits%20FAQ https%3A%2F%2Fbainz.ca%2Fpersona-5-royal-traits-faq%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with Whats App" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://bainz.ca/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://bainz.ca/ultimate-persona-team-persona-5-builds/" class="invert" rel="prev">Ultimate Persona Team (Persona 5 Builds)</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://bainz.ca/ultimate-persona-team-persona-5-royal-builds/" class="invert" rel="next">Ultimate Persona Team (Persona 5 Royal Builds)</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://bainz.ca/persona-4-golden-builds/"><img src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/8/responsive/1_cz97DqG8yiPh2G2k3lz-rQ-xs.webp" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://bainz.ca/persona-4-golden-builds/" class="invert">Persona 4 Golden Best Personas &amp; Builds</a></h4><time datetime="2025-01-08T08:50">Jan 8, 2025</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://bainz.ca/lavenza-boss-fight-guide-persona-5-royal/"><img src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/7/responsive/maxresdefault-16-xs.webp" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://bainz.ca/lavenza-boss-fight-guide-persona-5-royal/" class="invert">Lavenza Boss Fight Guide  (Persona 5 Royal)</a></h4><time datetime="2025-01-08T08:45">Jan 8, 2025</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://bainz.ca/persona-5-royal-party-member-builds/"><img src="https://bainz.ca/media/posts/6/responsive/ksJmxHAF3c4PV9N7MRvLCeWb-xs.webp" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://bainz.ca/persona-5-royal-party-member-builds/" class="invert">Persona 5 Royal Party Member Builds</a></h4><time datetime="2025-01-08T08:39">Jan 8, 2025</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii & Github</div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://twitter.com/bainnz" class="twitter" aria-label="Twitter"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://bainz.ca/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://youtube.com/bainz" class="youtube" aria-label="Youtube"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://bainz.ca/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#youtube"/></svg></a></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://bainz.ca/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=4268bfae06e330d473c424d50f09abda"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
