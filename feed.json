This post contains the builds I had on each teammate at the end of my first playthrough. These builds can of course be changed however you want, if there are some skills I got rid of, that you’d rather keep.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In the following video, I went over each character, what they do and my thoughts on them as party members (check out the rest of my YouTube too btw). While it does contain a tier list format, it was very much intended as just a way to discuss each character, rather than their specific placements.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LxfFwMA7J3Q\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In the above video, I probably did overrate/underrate some of the party members. I rated Yukari pretty highly simply because I found her to be the most convenient/comfortable Healer to use, but Ken has a lot of things going for him, so they can be fairly interchangeable. If I was making this list again, I’d probably move Koromaru up a tier, his combination of coverage moves, AoE Charge, Revolution, and (eventually) Masukukaja/Debilitate are way too good. The dog is OP.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/egLpQcgmqZU\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In the above video, I made an updated ranking, taking into account the Episode Aigis DLC, as well as more time playing the game! Check it out.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Related:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/ultimate-persona-team-persona-5-royal-builds-1ec9f2fee2b5\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/ultimate-persona-team-persona-5-royal-builds-1ec9f2fee2b5\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Persona 5 Royal Builds</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-5-royal-party-member-builds-7505384717de\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-5-royal-party-member-builds-7505384717de\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Persona 5 Royal Party Member Builds</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-4-golden-builds-4e6873e91089\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-4-golden-builds-4e6873e91089\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Persona 4 Golden Builds</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-4-golden-party-member-builds-77b823572695\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-4-golden-party-member-builds-77b823572695\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Persona 4 Golden Party Member Builds</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"section section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Yukari</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mWpnDuBF8vGX2guBowJIcw.png\" alt=\"Yukari\" data-image-id=\"1*mWpnDuBF8vGX2guBowJIcw.png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Yukari is your standard Healer: she heals, removes ailments, lowers enemy agility, and heals even more. The main draw for Yukari are her characteristics, which reduce her SP costs for healing by 50-75%. This lets you have basically infinite healing for Tartarus runs and boss fights. Do you need that much healing? Probably no, but it’s still nice to have sometimes. Yukari’s 2nd Theurgy is a full team Concentrate (2.3x Damage in Reload), allowing her to support the team even more. Magic isn’t as strong as Phys in P3R, but I’m not gonna complain about that type of support skill on a healer.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Diarahan on this build could be swapped out, as Yukari’s characteristic makes full team healing so cheap as it is. But there’s not really any good move to replace it with (I’m never using Wind Break or ailments tbh). So I was fine keeping it here.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Junpei</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ssev7tDrZVhqGoW-lcnY5g.png\" data-image-id=\"1*ssev7tDrZVhqGoW-lcnY5g.png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Junpei is your Critical Hit specialist in P3R, with his Theurgy charging faster after landing a crit and his characteristic increasing his Critical Rate &amp; Damage. Junpei can benefit quite a bit from gear, so getting the Omega Drive accessory (available as a reward for saving the missing person in Tartarus Floor 177) or his Ultimate Weapon (Masakado’s Katana in the Antique Store) would be pretty good for him, providing Apt Pupil (2x Crit Rate). Another great mid-game accessory for Junpei are the Slash Bracers (Slash Boost) from the Antique Store.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I didn’t keep Junpei’s Strike attack on this build (Gigantic Fist), as late game the damage on it isn’t impressive and I have MC/Akihiko/Aigis for Strike.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Akihiko</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TyL4kTVNM_jxwV_1hmlPNg.png\" data-image-id=\"1*TyL4kTVNM_jxwV_1hmlPNg.png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Akihiko can be one of the most misunderstood characters in P3R, simply because the wording on his Theurgy condition is awful. In-game it states, “After strengthening himself, his fighting spirit rises”. This makes it seem like you have to use Aki to buff himself, but how it actually works is: whenever Aki’s turn begins, if he has any type of buff on him, his Theurgy charges faster. Any teamwide buff works for this, making Akihiko have one of the fastest charging Theurgies.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">His final characteristic Buff Amp doesn’t specify it’s value either, but it actually gives a 1.3x Boost to any type of buff. This means that when Akihiko has an Attack Buff, instead of the normal 1.4x Damage, he’ll do ~1.82x Damage.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">All this means Akihiko will be one of the highest damaging party members you have, and he works with either Phys or Magic. His support options of Atk Down/Agi Up aren’t the best out of the team, so he’s definitely not a must pick character, but he’s very solid.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The Double Ziggurat weapon (Strike Amp) and Strike Bracers accessory (Strike Boost) help his physical damage a lot. Don’t use Evil Gloves (his “Ultimate Weapon”) on Akihiko, if MC has a Persona with Auto-Mataru/Maraku/Masuku, that weapon does literally nothing. I did keep both the Single Target and AoE Electric skills on Akihiko, but one of them could be replaced with Shock Boost.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Mitsuru</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*33DX9tEWoAxdKM0YeowVUA.png\" data-image-id=\"1*33DX9tEWoAxdKM0YeowVUA.png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mk7PIxAwjKzR1Mw7wiL4fA.png\" data-image-id=\"1*mk7PIxAwjKzR1Mw7wiL4fA.png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Episode Aigis</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Mitsuru is your main Magic damage dealer throughout the game. Because of how skewed Reload is in favor of Phys, Akihiko/Junpei/Aigis will generally out-damage her, but she has some other things going for her. The support skill of Rakunda/Marakunda lowering enemy defense is super nice to have, being a reliable way to increase your whole team’s damage by 40% in any situation.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Her characteristic increases the Critical Rate of the whole party on enemies inflicted with an ailment. If you use the “Assassin Website Note” (from Club Escapade in September) on the dorm PC, you can acquire the ability to put Distress on enemies automatically when you ambush them. This lets you have a decent crit rate boost in almost every random encounter. Ailments are pretty much never useful for bosses, so that aspect of Mitsuru’s kit definitely takes a hit in those situations.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For Mitsuru to do max damage late game, you’d want to have the Kokuseki Senjin weapon (Magic Ability) and Varna Bracers accessory (Ice Amp) from the Antique Store. On this build, I did remove Neuro Slash as it doesn’t do much damage. I kept Ice Break as many late game enemies block Ice, but it could be replaced with Freeze Boost.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In Episode Aigis, Mitsuru got Vorpal Blade, so she can actually be a Phys DPS with Slash/Crit gear. See my Episode Aigis ranking for more info.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Aigis</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tvtrYiaA3f0Hwi3_-CLQdQ.png\" data-image-id=\"1*tvtrYiaA3f0Hwi3_-CLQdQ.png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Aigis is your go-to buffer and Pierce damage dealer in the game. She also gets Resist Phys, Enduring Soul, Insta-Heal and the highest base Endurance stat for any party member, making her very tanky. Aigis’ best armor has a Null Ailments passive, which is why I didn’t keep Insta-Heal on this build. Aigis is pretty straightforward, using Phys attacks charge her Theurgy, her characteristic increases the damage of said Phys attacks, and you have Atk/Def buffs available to use.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Koromaru</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*X_kD06AysfxTp5JMWg34iw.png\" data-image-id=\"1*X_kD06AysfxTp5JMWg34iw.png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Koromaru is simply one of the best party members in the game. As soon as you get him, Koro is able to use 2 Theurgies, with the 2nd one, Power Howling, being a full party Charge. This is, in my opinion, the strongest support move in the game, as Phys is so good in Reload, and it lets any party member do 2.3x more damage with their next Phys attack.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">He gets coverage options in Fire, Dark, Slash, Almighty, and you can even get a weapon in the mid-game (Hazakura in the Antique Store) that turns his basic attack to Wind affinity, letting him hit 4 weaknesses. Revolution boosts your whole team’s crit rate. Masukukaja and Debilitate come pretty far in, but they add a lot to Koro’s support skill set.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Last thing to note about Koro is, Getsu-ei is a lot stronger than Tempest Slash when you are close to a Full Moon. And since pretty much every relevant fight happens on a Full Moon day, it’s a lot better to keep. Also, it has higher crit rate (15% vs 8% base chance). In Episode Aigis, Getsu-Ei got removed, so just use Tempest Slash.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Ken</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pcvYBDS_hbExQv7GRdXe_A.png\" data-image-id=\"1*pcvYBDS_hbExQv7GRdXe_A.png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*u4_t4eNJgDoXXhsNyaEizA.png\" data-image-id=\"1*u4_t4eNJgDoXXhsNyaEizA.png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Episode Aigis</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Ken is your second Healer, and he does get a number of different moves in his kit. He gets Electric, Light and Pierce coverage moves, so he’s able to hit more weaknesses than most party members. I didn’t keep Vile Assault on this build, but you can still get Pierce knockdowns with Ken’s basic attack. Most of the time, I’d use MC/Aigis/Junpei for Pierce so I opted to keep more of Ken’s support skills. I didn’t keep Samarecarm either, as revive items are fairly accessible, so the skill slot felt better used on other stuff.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In Episode Aigis, Ken learnt some new Pierce moves, including Myriad Arrows. I found myself not using Heat Riser much (prefer full party buffs), so I kept the 2 Pierce moves this time.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Ken has screens for Tetrakarn and Makarkarn, and his 2nd Theurgy takes this one step further, fully healing and reviving all teammates, as well as providing 1 layer of each screen for everyone. This is a great Theurgy, and if you keep Ken below 50% SP, he can get it back really quickly (every 3 turns). I didn’t use Ken as much during the Journey, but in Episode Aigis with combat being more difficult, I appreciated his kit a lot more and used him a ton!</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Metis</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*417ye600MAol0uaCEfxxug.png\" data-image-id=\"1*417ye600MAol0uaCEfxxug.png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Episode Aigis</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The most broken character, aside from MC. Does a ton of damage, has Charge, 2 great Strike Theurgies, Wind/Ice coverage (I removed these on the final build cause I didn’t need them as much late game), Attack buff, no weaknesses, good characteristic, etc etc etc. Basically Journey Aigis and Shinji in one.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you got this far, thanks for reading! I’ll definitely be making more videos/posts for Persona 3 Reload, so be sure to check out my YouTube and some other posts I have linked here.

Similarly, some of the supports don’t have Boon Boost/Boon Boost EX, because Dekaja and Dekunda are used so frequently in that fight.

It’s a really strong skill for this point in the game, allowing her to stay useful to the very end. It costs a ton of MP, but you basically only use it in boss fights anyways. I added Boon Boost, Mana Spring and Resist Elec to her skill set. Here’s a quick video on building her:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GYg_-RL9Fk8\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Yoshitsune</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FH4kdJBBJ3NnSpTBp16GXA.png\" data-image-id=\"1*FH4kdJBBJ3NnSpTBp16GXA.png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Hassou Tobi competes with the endgame Phys skills, and always lands a critical hit, granting you an extra press turn. This combined with the fact you can fuse Yoshitsune at Level 45, makes him a great Demon to use.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGuCSKJ2dm8\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Cleopatra</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CKW1yFqcewwZ7_qIt6-rww.png\" data-image-id=\"1*CKW1yFqcewwZ7_qIt6-rww.png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Cleopatra, a DLC Demon, makes for a great de-buffer. Her skill Frolic can charm enemies, in addition to lowering their attack/defense by 2 stages. She has great stats, resistances, skill potentials, really no downsides.

Lucifer’s exclusive skill Morning Star can be used to basically delete everything, and he also starts out with the best resistances as well. This build is centered around abusing technicals by applying Dizzy, then following up with Morning Star to break boss shields and do a lot of damage. Dizzy is the ailment used because bosses are susceptible to it, and if an opponent is inflicted, any attack on them becomes a technical. Only the Final Boss and the first phase of the Osaka Jail boss are immune to Dizzy, for every other one you can apply the ailment and start comboing them with Morning Star.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sJReRSWaWuc\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Alice</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8v8axXcW_acWEMvfcDHzOQ.png\" data-image-id=\"1*8v8axXcW_acWEMvfcDHzOQ.png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Alice is essentially the best trash mob clearer in the game. As long as a non-boss opponent doesn’t block/resist Curse, they can quickly be taken out with Die for Me. I also added Maeigaon and Curse Boost/Amp, just in case Insta-Kills don’t work in certain situations. I normally start battles with Alice equipped, as she clears dungeons the fastest, so I put Attack/Speed Master on her to always start out with those buffs, without having to continually swap Personas. Alice’s combo skills of Concentrate, Mamudoon and Megidolaon are also some of the best in general.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Metatron</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7Dx4xlZrCcu0RTGdQXSseA.png\" data-image-id=\"1*7Dx4xlZrCcu0RTGdQXSseA.png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Metatron is the Bless-based counterpart to Alice, which is why I gave him Mahamaon, to deal with any enemies that block Curse insta-kills. Mahamaon has a lower chance for insta-kill than Die for Me, but it has a much wider range, making Metatron just as good for dungeon clearing. I kept Sword Dance and added Knockdown Style (Greatly decreases Down Gauge when landing a critical hit) just for when I felt like using the Physical skill instead of magic ones.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Yoshitsune</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UHTmlwHyKGAKl5Qi4MlWRQ.png\" data-image-id=\"1*UHTmlwHyKGAKl5Qi4MlWRQ.png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">One of the strongest Personas from previous games returns, and is no disappointment. Yoshitsune’s Hassou Tobi continues to be a very good skill (though it’s not the strongest anymore, see the damage video I did below), and can be used to clear both mobs and bosses. This build is centered around applying Shock with Wild Thunder (most bosses are still susceptible to it), which allows for Phys skills like Hassou Tobi to become a technical, letting it easily break shields and hit for more damage. Yoshitsune can’t inherit Magic skills, so I had to use a skill card for Wild Thunder, but even Zio could be used in that slot as it’s being used for the ailment more so than damage. If an Elec skill card can’t be found, Freeze or Dizzy can work in place of Shock. Salvation is on here to quickly heal (Hassou Tobi costs 30% HP) without having to swap Personas, but it could be replaced by just Diarahan or the healing skill could be on a separate Persona.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Black Frost</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xsRqXwqkvFfJ5ajcsuFmbA.png\" data-image-id=\"1*xsRqXwqkvFfJ5ajcsuFmbA.png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Black Frost’s build is based around the same idea as Yoshitsune, just with applying Freeze and following up with a strong Phys skill. Agneyastra is actually the highest damage Phys move in the game, above even Hassou Tobi (see damage vid below).</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Arsene</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VmRdtP6onir0eZg1gshj3w.png\" data-image-id=\"1*VmRdtP6onir0eZg1gshj3w.png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Have to keep the starter around and I stuck with the same build for Arsene as Lucifer, because Dizzy+Almighty can be used to beat almost every boss. This type of build is of course better on Lucifer, because Morning Star does about 50% more damage than Megidolaon, but I still tend to use Arsene more often. The remaining skills slots are taken up by Debilitate and Heat Riser, which are some of the best skills in the game and can be put on any Persona. Arsene actually has a full skill tree for once, learning Maeigaon and Riot Gun at later levels, so a Curse or Gun Build could also work for him.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"section section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe\">\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8podzML-Mz8\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></figure>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Two things might be noticeable for these Personas. One is that most have a weakness or two which isn’t patched up, the reason being that you can often keep a boss permanently staggered by hitting their weakness or a technical, giving them little opportunity to target you, so your own weak point doesn’t matter as much. But if you find yourself getting hit and knocked down many times, Resist/Null skills can be added in place of other ones.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The second thing is the lack of Charge/Concentrate. In previous Personas, using those skills was a no brainer because it resulted in the next turn’s attack doing 2.5x damage. In Strikers, using Charge/Conc has the same effect, but due to the action style of the game, taking time to use those skills can feel unnecessary. The timer of how long an enemy is inflicted with an ailment continues to go down when casting Charge/Conc, so it often seems better to attack as many times as possible during that window, instead of powering up for one stronger attack. It’s basically personal preference, but I rarely feel the need to use those skills this time around.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Most builds on here center around ailments and capitalizing on them, so they’re most effective with a high Luck stat and the Bond skill ‘Luck Boost’ levelled as high as possible. Ailments and insta-kills will feel a lot weaker otherwise.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">As can be seen by Arsene, any Persona can be usable if you invest stats into them. Some other good Personas, based on their element, what skills they learn and what combos they have:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Fire: Cerberus, Mara</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Ice: King Frost</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Elec: Thor, Raja Naga</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Wind: Norn, Fortuna</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Psy: Forneus, Kali</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Nuke: Mot, Trumpeter, Ganesha</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Curse: Abaddon</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Gun: Seth</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>",

His supports of Masukukaja/Youthful Wind and Dekaja can prove useful at multiple points, especially against Golden Hands, who like to boost their evasion. The lack of Power/Mind Charge puts him a bit below the other members in boss fights, but he’s still solid overall.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">S. Link Skills: Trafuri, Dekaja, Auto-Sukukaja, Diarama, Evade Elec</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Bike Skills: Confuse Boost, Megido, Green Wall, Makara Break, Diarahan</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Chie</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ux3kGcVRtF4aZDfw8g3a7w.png\" data-image-id=\"1*Ux3kGcVRtF4aZDfw8g3a7w.png\" data-width=\"1378\" data-height=\"773\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For Chie, I went strictly with Phys skills for her, as the best Ice move she learns normally is Bufula and she only gets Ice Boost (no Amp). After 5 Bike Rides, she does learn Bufudyne, but I didn’t think it was worth it (at least on a 1st playthrough). Bufula could be kept instead of High Counter here. So I stuck with God’s Hand/Agneyastra, and her critical buffing skills of Revolution and Apt Pupil. Dragon Hustle (party Heat Riser) is a great 3rd tier skill, despite it costing 150 SP. Due to Chie’s low SP pool, it’d prob be worth equipping the Chakra Ring (halves SP cost of skills, can be found after beating the 6th Dungeon optional boss) when using that move.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">S. Link Skills: Rebellion, Ice Boost, Revolution, Bufula, Evade Fire</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Bike Skills: Hama, Mind Slice, Hamaon, Tetra Break, Bufudyne</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Yukiko</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3Dp3g-bun8Jf4Os9jHwaZQ.png\" data-image-id=\"1*3Dp3g-bun8Jf4Os9jHwaZQ.png\" data-width=\"1378\" data-height=\"773\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">As these builds are from my first playthrough, I didn’t have the chance to take Yukiko on 5 Bike rides, but Mind Charge is definitely worth doing that (it would replace Agidyne here). With Burning Petals (Severe Fire damage to all), Yukiko can actually come close to Yu in terms of magic damage. She’s also a great healer to have in the party, and prior to learning Mediarahan/Salvation, Divine Grace and Amrita are good skills to keep on her.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">S. Link Skills: Mudo, Divine Grace, Amrita, Mudoon, Evade Ice</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Bike Skills: Valiant Dance, Matarunda, Red Wall, Spirit Drain, Mind Charge</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Kanji</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8mnxUAnz23GnIZgm5rxWMg.png\" data-image-id=\"1*8mnxUAnz23GnIZgm5rxWMg.png\" data-width=\"1378\" data-height=\"773\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Kanji just hits hard. Even though he only learns single-target Phys skills by level up, I used him more than Chie, as he’s stronger and bosses tend to only require single-target anyway (though Chie is good for dungeons because she gets Apt Pupil). Given that Kanji favors Phys skills, Regenerate 3 was chosen over Elec Boost. Before learning The Man’s Way (Chance of causing Down and Dizzy to all), I kept Masukunda for the whole time prior.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">S. Link Skills: Dizzy Boost, Masukunda, Power Charge, Regenerate 3, Evade Wind</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Bike Skills: Media, Atom Smasher, Blue Wall, Fast Heal, Mediarama</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Teddie</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yZ6lx1ddMH2c0O9869h6qQ.png\" data-image-id=\"1*yZ6lx1ddMH2c0O9869h6qQ.png\" data-width=\"1378\" data-height=\"773\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Teddie is the second healer of the group and he gets the Ice skills that Chie doesn’t. I tended to use Yukiko over Teddie for healing, because Yukiko learns Divine Grace naturally, but an accessory named Blessed Hands (from Tanaka’s Amazing Commodities) can be equipped for Teddie to have Divine Grace as well. Despite being a bit overshadowed by Yukiko, having Teddie in the same party as Yukiko can let her focus on attacking instead of healing, leaving Teddie to be the heal/support member, which he isn’t that bad at. Kamui Miracle, Teddie’s 3rd Tier skill, can replace one of these moves (if you like RNG). One skill not on here is Marakunda (all enemy defense down), I replaced it due to MC having Debilitate later on, but prior to that it’s a very good move to keep. Matarukaja can also be kept if you’re not using Kanji.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">S. Link Skills: Auto-Rakukaja, Recarm, Marakunda, Samarecarm, Evade Elec</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Bike Skills: Dekunda, Life Drain, Mustard Bomb, White Wall, Evade Physical</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Naoto</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CODN8-byTb3NZGW8fCrl_Q.png\" data-image-id=\"1*CODN8-byTb3NZGW8fCrl_Q.png\" data-width=\"1378\" data-height=\"773\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Naoto’s really a character that gets too many good skills. She gets the 4 high tier Elementals, both multi-target Insta-Kills, Megidolaon, Vorpal Blade/Myriad Arrows, Tetrakarn/Makarakarn and even Angelic Grace. With the number of skills she learns, I don’t think there’s an ‘optimal’ Naoto build, it kinda comes down to personal preference.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I went with Mahamaon and Mamudoon (along with Hama/Mudo Boost) for clearing mobs, and Mind Charge+Megidolaon for boss fights. I preferred using the insta-kill moves with Naoto, but keeping the elemental skills isn’t bad either. Shield of Justice (Shields the party from all damage once) costs 160 SP and is too niche to be used often outside of Super Boss fights, so it could be replaced with something else (I had Invigorate 3 prior).</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">S. Link Skills: Invigorate 1, Mind Charge, Invigorate 2, Heat Riser, Invigorate 3</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Bike Skills: Bufudyne, Ziodyne, Tetraja, Myriad Arrows, Angelic Grace</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>",

I posted two videos recently, one beating Lavenza with a full party and one with solo Joker. First part of this post will focus on beating Lavenza with a full party, second half is with the solo route.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OMx1z3q2a_I\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kYxoDsrBHcQ\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"section section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Party</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Lavenza has 4 Phases and moves twice per turn.

Makoto because you need a healer, and Makoto’s endgame stats tend to be a lot higher than Morgana’s due to her ultimate gun that gives +11 All Stats. Ryuji could be swapped in as the healer if you have sufficient Somas/Bead Chains or the Salvation Crown, as his Tier 3 skill Fighting Spirit can benefit Haru/Sumire.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_KxPpk0P3CbGKa409IdBYw.png\" data-image-id=\"1*_KxPpk0P3CbGKa409IdBYw.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"808\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Haru is in the party because she can land technicals off nearly all ailments with Psiodyne, land criticals using One-Shot Kill, her trait lowers ailment susceptibility by 50% and her tier 3 skill Life Wall can be useful during the last phase. Sumire can raise the critical rate of the whole party and land criticals with the most consistency due to Sword Dance and Apt Pupil. Sumire’s trait Veil of Midnight also has a chance to prevent allies from being downed when their weaknesses are hit. I switched Yusuke in for Makoto during Phase 4, because his trait helps the party avoid Lavenza’s chainsaw attacks, but it’s def not 100% necessary. This is the just the party I prefer using, not necessarily the most ‘optimal’ one. Accessories: Apt Pupil for Haru (Advanced Home Run Mini-Game or Itemize Tsukiyomi), Orichalcum R for Sumire (Itemize Orichalcum), Salvation Crown for Makoto (Tanaka’s Shady Commodities).</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NMqY9HDIx0JhiSpbKYCq8w.png\" data-image-id=\"1*NMqY9HDIx0JhiSpbKYCq8w.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"809\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The basic strategy was Concentrating with Joker first, Makoto could heal/support, then Haru and Sumire would go for crits with One-Shot Kill and Sword Dance, Baton Passing to Joker for the big damage hit. You don’t need max stats on Joker’s Personas btw, they just help in speeding things up.</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Phase 1, start with a Will of the Sword Persona equipped on Joker. Will of the Sword is bugged to give an Auto-Concentrate when you begin with it, and Dekaja can’t remove Concentrate. I had Jack Frost and Baal with Diamond Dust and Panta Rhei to deal damage. With Crits and Baton Passes (and good RNG), this phase can end in a couple turns.</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Phase 2, casting Rage on Lavenza halves her defense, Haru Psiodyne and Joker Psycho Force (with Kohryu’s Universal Law) can end the phase in 1 turn.</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Before Phase 3, ideally have Sumire use Brave Step. Then just hope you land a crit with someone, and do as much damage as possible when Lavenza is downed.</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Phase 4 is actually where you can breathe a little bit. If Joker has an Enduring Soul Persona, you really have 10 of your turns to finish off Lavenza. You almost want to get to the Megidolaon turn, because if Lavenza knocks everyone out but Joker, Futaba’s Ultimate Support can activate, reviving/healing everyone and giving the whole party Heat Riser. Just keep chipping Lavenza down until you win. (If Ultimate Support doesn’t activate after the others die, use Maria’s Holy Benevolence or a Revive-All item from Takemi.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Speaking of Futaba, how well your fight with Lavenza goes can often just come down to whether you get good RNG with Futaba’s support skills. If Futaba gives you full party Charge/Concentrate or Ultimate Support often, it can be a breeze. Or, she can just not show up at all.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">That is basically the gist of the fight. You can watch the video I posted to see how it plays out turn by turn, and I showed the Personas I used near the end.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"section section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Solo (with DLC)</h4>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1jjjOr5b-o4\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Beating Lavenza solo is a bit different. Because you don’t have party members, reaching the 5000 damage thresholds and landing technicals by yourself every turn can seem impossible. But luckily, it is possible and made a lot easier with the help of DLC. Credit to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/iisroking\" data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/iisroking\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Youtuber named 藍山</a>, who had a great breakdown on how to complete this fight solo.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In Phase 1, Lavenza’s pattern is always the same. It’s Wage War (Rage)+Fire, Nocturnal Flash (Dizzy)+Electric, Lullaby (Sleep)+Ice and Tentarafoo (Confuse)+Wind. So if you come in with the right Personas, you can take 0 damage and deal the 5000 damage needed. Start with a Will of the Sword Persona equipped, because the bug will give you Auto-Concentrate. Next, the most important Persona is either Asterius or Izanagi-no-Okami. Asterius’ trait Frenzied Bull, “Increases damage to foes when low on HP”, this means that when you are below 50% HP, Frenzied Bull doubles your damage. Izanagi-nO’s trait Country Maker, “Increases Attack/Defense based on Inmate Registry completion”, meaning when you have a full Persona compendium it doubles your damage. Both these traits provide the same 2x multiplier, Frenzied Bull just requires you to be below 50% HP, Country Maker is best with a full compendium. You want to have Panta Rhei on either of these Personas, because you’ll attack after Lavenza has used an Electric move.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Otherwise, you’ll need a support Persona (or multiple support Personas) with Debilitate, Rebellion and Concentrate. This Persona should have the trait Positive Thoughts or Wealth of Lotus to extend their buffs by 2 turns (for Rebellion). This Persona should also ideally block Fire, Ice, Elec and Wind, with its natural resistances and/or using Null/Drain/Repel passives. If you block everything Lavenza uses in Phase 1, then you can rely on Insta-Heal (passive or via an accessory) to heal from the ailments she uses. Once you have the right Persona(s), the Phase 1 turn order is just:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Debilitate/Dekaja, Debilitate/Heat Riser, Panta Rhei, Concentrate, Rebellion, Debilitate, Panta Rhei</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6Pb80OtI6v7zeFP5YU3tDQ.png\" data-image-id=\"1*6Pb80OtI6v7zeFP5YU3tDQ.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"809\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">That’ll get you to Phase 2, where you have to land a technical every turn. This is the part where it’s all luck based. Going into the fight, you need to have the Cocytus Ice gun equipped (from the Airsoft shop), because it will allow you to freeze Lavenza. You need to freeze her using one of your first 3 bullets, then technical using another bullet. This will count as your technical hit for the turn, and you’ll get a 1 More, where you should Concentrate using either the Persona you had equipped, the Ring of Greed accessory or a Star Onion. Then on the next turn, your goal is to crit Lavenza using a physical move that applies Sleep/Dizzy (Dream Needle, Dormin Rush, Sledgehammer, Flash Bomb). Dream Needle seems to be the best because it can be used in conjunction with Apt Pupil and Trigger Happy, plus it has a Medium chance of Sleep. Knocking her down here and applying the ailment will allow you to switch to the highest damaging Persona you have (namely Izanagi-no-Okami with Myriad Truths), and hit the technical while Lavenza is down. A Concentrated Myriad Truths here does over 11k damage, letting you entirely skip the whole Critical Hit Phase 3 of the fight. Putting Repel Fire on Izanagi-nO can be useful, because Lavenza will always use Blazing Hell after Phase 2 is done.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*alkyxL_oO-7vWogw9_MKkA.png\" data-image-id=\"1*alkyxL_oO-7vWogw9_MKkA.png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"448\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Given the requirements of Phase 2, the solo success rate is not high. In my experience, you land a Freeze using your first 3 bullets about 50% of the time. And then getting the crit/ailment afterwards is like a… 20–30% chance. So it’s about a 1/8 chance you get past Phase 2 using this method.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Once you finish Phase 2 and skip Phase 3, Phase 4 is very simple. Just concentrate and Myriad Truths until it’s finished. Check out the posted video above if any of this didn’t make complete sense (I have all the Personas I used included at the end).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"section section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Solo (No DLC)</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Beating Lavenza Solo without DLC is similar to the previous section, but it requires many more attempts due to the amount of RNG present. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClA2oEpslLQBih5kfsGCZaQ\" data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClA2oEpslLQBih5kfsGCZaQ\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Big credit to RobLu L</a> (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/8q66mIUz4D0\" data-href=\"https://youtu.be/8q66mIUz4D0\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check out their Lavenza vid</a>), I thought this fight was likely impossible without DLC, until I saw their strategy for Phase 3. If attempting solo, I’d recommend just using Izanagi-nO, cause it would save a lot of time. But if interested in knowing how the No DLC route works, read ahead.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kE9xy9_PgDZwTnc7qOuVHA.png\" data-image-id=\"1*kE9xy9_PgDZwTnc7qOuVHA.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"810\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In Phase 1, the pattern was Dekaja/Debilitate, Ice damage, Concentrate, Fire damage, Concentrate, Debilitate, Critical (One-Shot Kill/Sword Dance) and Wind damage. With Repels (from a Persona with Retaliating Body), this allows you to deal 5000+ damage and end the phase with Lavenza’s stats lowered. The Ice and Fire Personas were Jack Frost and Surt with Intense Focus (Mighty Gaze and Will of the Sword also work). The Wind Persona was Satanael, as he has max magic damage due to Tyrant’s Mind (not counting DLC obvs). The critical in this phase boosts on the damage on the Wind attack, letting the Phase end before Lavenza uses Dekunda.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For Phase 2, having Lavenza’s stats lowered beforehand matters because she starts the phase with Heat Riser. If Lavenza’s evasion is raised here, it makes the following steps even less reliable, so that’s why it’s important. Next is the Freeze (or Shock) technical with the gun, and the Dream Needle critical/ailment. Once these are applied, Kohryu should be used for his trait Universal Law (Technical damage +50%), doing ~6.5k damage and ending the phase.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In Phase 3, Lavenza can use Tetrakarn, making it impossible to progress alone. But you can force Lavenza to not use Tetrakarn by using Personas that are weak to her attacks (Psy/Nuke). Lavenza will go after Joker’s weaknesses instead of setting up Tetrakarn, and this is why Kohryu and Arahabaki are used. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/gktce4/testing_p5rs_battle_mechanics_part_2_evasion/\" data-href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/gktce4/testing_p5rs_battle_mechanics_part_2_evasion/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ali Dance and Angelic Grace don’t stack</a> so using Evade skills, with Enduring Soul, is the best bet on these two.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DN3d-lBRXtYJFRjFZ0JQGg.png\" data-image-id=\"1*DN3d-lBRXtYJFRjFZ0JQGg.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"809\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">One-Shot Kill with Gun Boost/Amp and Trigger Happy can also be used here</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">As Arahabaki was the Critical dealing Persona, I put Vitality of the Tree (Allows use of ambushed skills normally) and Adverse Resolve (Critical rate up when ambushed) on him. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/gkthop/testing_p5rs_battle_mechanics_part_3_critical_hits/\" data-href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/gkthop/testing_p5rs_battle_mechanics_part_3_critical_hits/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Based on this post by bryanktr</a>, Adverse Resolve does work with Vitality of Tree (although other passives like Last Stand don’t). That’s why Vitality of the Tree was on the critical-hit Personas (Attis, Rangda, Arahabaki). I used Sword Dance instead of One-Shot Kill because it allowed for more space for passives like Regenerate 3 and Evade Psy/Nuke. Even with Apt Pupil and Adverse Resolve, a critical hit cap of 60% exists in P5R, so Undying Fury (Phys skills +30%) could be used instead of Vitality of the Tree. This Phase requires 2–3 crits, depending on if Futaba buffs your attack or if you dodge Lavenza’s moves (which prevents her from using Dekunda). Debilitate/Heat Riser and Hassou Tobi are the best moves after getting a critical.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vz3Dwv_KJeriuo050OlwTw.png\" data-image-id=\"1*vz3Dwv_KJeriuo050OlwTw.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"810\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Endure and Enduring Soul work separately, so Endure can be used for this Persona (you don’t need HP in Phase 4)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Phase 4 is the simplest, just equip a Repel All Persona with Retaliating Body (Gun/Fire/Elec can be Drain/Null instead of Repel bc Lavenza blocks those) and lower defense. Repelling everything does more damage than attacking in this part. One of either Endure, Enduring Soul or Futaba’s Final Guard needs to last until this point to make it past Lavenza’s Megidolaon with Lucifer. If you make it this far, congrats! This is definitely the hardest challenge fight in Persona 5, and one of the hardest in the series for sure.

In Vanilla P5, you were basically stuck with the skills they learnt by level up, meaning some party members felt distinctly inferior to others by the endgame.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In P5R, you have access to the Jazz Club, which you can use to boost a party member’s stats or have them learn a new skill. A full list of Jazz Club skills can be found <a href=\"https://samurai-gamers.com/persona-5/jazz-jin-bar-guide/\" data-href=\"https://samurai-gamers.com/persona-5/jazz-jin-bar-guide/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on this page</a>, but I’ll list the ones I feel most important: 9/4 Charge, 9/25 Concentrate, 12/4 Heat Riser, 12/11 Debilitate, 1/15 Ali Dance, 1/22 Arms Master and 1/29 Spell Master.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">P5R also added Persona Traits, which act as unique abilities that can benefit the party in different ways. Given the new options available, I wanted to post the party builds I had at the end of my first playthrough and talk about each character a bit. At the end of this post, I also listed some of the best accessories to equip, as well as how to get the Ultimate Weapons for each character. For a full list of trait and skill descriptions, <a href=\"https://aqiu384.github.io/megaten-fusion-tool/p5r/skills\" data-href=\"https://aqiu384.github.io/megaten-fusion-tool/p5r/skills\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check this page</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For the accessory slot on the characters, I tried to put different options that suited their specific skill set, mainly relevant during the endgame. For most of the game, the best accessory to have on nearly every character is the SP Adhesive 3 (Takemi’s clinic at Rank 5, 50% discount at Rank 7). If you have the DLC, itemizing Izanagi-no-Okami gives an accessory that is the same as the SP Adhesive 3 and gives +3 All Stats. For Joker’s Personas and this same sorta post for P4G and P3R:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/ultimate-persona-team-persona-5-royal-builds-1ec9f2fee2b5\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/ultimate-persona-team-persona-5-royal-builds-1ec9f2fee2b5\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor\" title=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/ultimate-persona-team-persona-5-royal-builds-1ec9f2fee2b5\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong\">Ultimate Persona Team (Persona 5 Royal Builds)</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-3-reload-party-member-builds-b3c9a22f6c44\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-3-reload-party-member-builds-b3c9a22f6c44\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor\" title=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-3-reload-party-member-builds-b3c9a22f6c44\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong\">Persona 3 Reload Party Member Builds</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-4-golden-party-member-builds-77b823572695\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-4-golden-party-member-builds-77b823572695\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor\" title=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-4-golden-party-member-builds-77b823572695\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong\">Persona 4 Golden Party Member Builds</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"section section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Morgana</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jrSaSdxaJFVo75G-JQFntA.png\" data-image-id=\"1*jrSaSdxaJFVo75G-JQFntA.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"808\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Trait: Majestic Presence — Doubles effectiveness and decreases costs of Recovery skills for all allies</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Accessory: Rosary of Purity — Holy Benevolence: Revive multiple fallen allies to max HP (Itemize Maria during an alarm)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Morgana’s trait, Proud Presence, doubles the effectiveness of party healing skills, making him the best healer until you get into the mid-to-late game. When Makoto eventually learns Marakukaja around the time of Palace 5/6, I tend to not use Morgana nearly as much. Though, Morgana is able to learn Marakukaja from the Jazz Club (on 7/17 and 10/16), so he doesn’t have to stay as frail as he was in Vanilla P5.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you want Morgana to be the best healer he can be, the Rosary of Purity accessory you get from itemizing Maria lets you revive multiple allies. If you mainly use Morgana to heal the party in between battles via the menu, the Black Headband R increases max SP by 30%.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Ryuji</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Lc_wec14R7DtEm_mmXBz_A.png\" data-image-id=\"1*Lc_wec14R7DtEm_mmXBz_A.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"810\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Trait: Eccentric Temper — Low chance to strengthen Phys attacks by 80% for all allies</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Accessory: Bravery Sash (Arms Master, P4 Protagonist fight DLC)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Ryuji’s probably the character that needs the least amount of work to be good, he’s very much unchanged from Vanilla P5: he hits hard, is tanky and is solid pretty much from beginning to end.

Although I didn’t keep her sleep skills of Dormina/Lullaby on the final build, I’d recommend keeping them on her for most of your playthrough, as Sleep allows for any type of attack to become a technical. Otherwise, I put Spell Master on her so she could use party-wide Concentrate as much as possible.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Yusuke</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OBvdyBc2ovAOPTwSv_jotg.png\" data-image-id=\"1*OBvdyBc2ovAOPTwSv_jotg.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"810\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Trait: Unparalleled Eyes — Greatly raises evasion rate against Phys attacks for all allies</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Accessory: Black Moon R — Apt Pupil, Str +8 (Tsukiyomi, Alarm)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Yusuke’s the character I most wanted to upgrade using the new skills from the Jazz Club. In Vanilla P5, it was often difficult to justify using Yusuke over Ryuji, because Ryuji got Matarukaja and Charge, meaning Yusuke’s damage output was considerably lower at the endgame. Another problem was, Yusuke is best as a Physical attacker, but his lower HP and Endurance stat made it so if he didn’t dodge an attack, you might have had to spend multiple turns reviving him.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Luckily in Royal, he can learn Charge, which mitigates his prior damage problems, and Arms Master, which makes the HP loss from his Phys skills much more manageable. And now, due to Ryuji’s trait having a chance to raise all ally Phys attacks, Yusuke and Ryuji no longer really compete with one another, but are best used on the same team.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Makoto</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yQ9Jy7on9BO1BArIaTbJ0Q.png\" data-image-id=\"1*yQ9Jy7on9BO1BArIaTbJ0Q.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"809\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Trait: Gaia Blessing — Increases chance of inflicting Burn, Freeze, and Shock by 50% for all allies</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Accessory: Magic Masangi (Spell Master, P3 Protagonist fight DLC)</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Other Accessories: Salvation Crown (Tanaka’s Shady Commodities)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Makoto’s great because she can heal, play support and isn’t lacking in damage output. Once she learns Mediarama and Marakukaja, I tend to use her as the healer instead of Morgana. Her original trait Gaia Pact increases the chances of Burn/Freeze/Shock, so she synergizes with any combination of Ann/Yusuke/Ryuji, and can hit Nuke technicals off those statused enemies. Not to mention, her Ultimate gun gives her +11 all stats, making her overall endgame stats quite a bit higher than other party members. I had her learn Debilitate from the Jazz Club on 12/11.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Haru</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0qPuwE9Z3FKD87q9PDHzTg.png\" data-image-id=\"1*0qPuwE9Z3FKD87q9PDHzTg.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"810\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Trait: Cool Customer — Reduces ailment susceptibility by 50% for all allies</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Accessory: Magic Masangi (Spell Master)</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Other Accessories: Black Moon R (Apt Pupil)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Haru is definitely a tough character to build for. Given she learns so many skills, you probably have to decide between Gun or Psy for her at some point. In Vanilla P5, I went with the Gun skills, because of their good damage and high crit-rates. A gun Haru build is still good in P5R, but I think the Psy one might actually be better this time around. The reason for this being two things: the new Technical Damage ranks and the Chaînés Hook ability you get from the Faith Confidant Rank 4.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HfAGhlu3j5fWRKEbw4PKjg.png\" data-image-id=\"1*HfAGhlu3j5fWRKEbw4PKjg.png\" data-width=\"585\" data-height=\"254\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Firstly, by going to the Billiards club in Kichijoji, you can <a href=\"https://www.thegamer.com/persona-5-royal-technical-rank-billiards-guide/\" data-href=\"https://www.thegamer.com/persona-5-royal-technical-rank-billiards-guide/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">increase your party’s Technical Damage rank</a>. As you raise your rank, you increase the damage boost and chance of knockdown when landing a tech, all the way up to Rank 4, where tech attacks have a guaranteed chance of knockdown. This is relevant for Haru, because Psy skills are what allow you to land technicals on almost all ailment types, including Sleep, Dizzy, Rage, Fear, Forget, Confuse, Despair and Brainwash. Given the benefits from Tech Rank 4, Haru can deal a fair bit of damage and get lots of knockdowns during a Palace run, if you are consistently applying ailments.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Secondly, the Chaînés Hook ability allows you to ambush enemies using your grappling hook. When these enemies are ambushed, there is a high chance of at least one enemy having the status ailment of Dizzy, Confuse or Fear. Given that you can use this all the time in Palaces instead of the normal ambush, it makes using Haru’s Psy skills even easier throughout the course of the game.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Otherwise, I gave her Concentrate to keep her damage output respectable during boss fights, and kept One-Shot Kill just to use it with the Apt Pupil accessory at times. Makarakarn/Tetrakarn are useful to keep on Haru, but can be replicated by items you buy from Takemi. Amrita Shower can come in clutch, but it’s not as relevant late-game because you likely have access to Salvation.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"section section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-divider\"> </div>\n<div>.</div>\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Akechi</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*N0CbtjsrzIq7oC77v7z3gg.png\" data-image-id=\"1*N0CbtjsrzIq7oC77v7z3gg.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"808\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Trait: Ingenious Spirit — Chance to halve Support and Almighty skill costs for all allies</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Accessory: St. Hermelin Badge (Null Bless/Curse)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Akechi gets high tier skills in Phys, Gun, Curse and Almighty, making him versatile at the cost of lacking damage output (due to no Boost/Amp skills). He gets one of the best support skills in Debilitate, which is very useful in boss fights. Debilitate is available earlier via the Jazz Club, but having it on Akechi is still nice.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Akechi’s trait Tactical Spirit has a chance to halve ally Support skill costs, and after some testing I did, the chance rate on it is about 60%. Due to his trait, you’re able to spam the Tier 3 skills like Fighting Spirit, High Energy, etc to a higher degree when he’s in your party. There aren’t a ton of opportunities where the reduced SP cost makes a big difference, but it’s a good bonus for just having him in the party.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">One last thing to know is that the Final Boss uses Bless skills, so equipping the St. Hermelin Badge or Ring of Vanity (which removes weaknesses) would help a lot there. Attack Master can be replaced with his Tier 3 skill Rebellion Blade, as Attack Master is redundant if Joker uses an Auto-Mataru Persona.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Kasumi</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xVTu1sm5BxPTJfw9yLBT6w.png\" data-image-id=\"1*xVTu1sm5BxPTJfw9yLBT6w.png\" data-width=\"1438\" data-height=\"718\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Trait: Veil of Sunrise — High chance to prevent down when weakness struck for all allies</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Accessory: Orichalcum R (Evade Phys, +7 All Stats)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The skills Kasumi learns are very focused and she works well because of that. She learns Sword Dance and Vorpal Blade, the highest crit-rate single target and multi-target Phys moves. Apt Pupil doubles the chance of landing a critical, while Ali Dance halves the foes accuracy, making up for her lower Endurance stat. Brave Step boosts the critical rate of the whole party, making her super useful in any situation where the enemy is susceptible to crits.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Kasumi isn’t super customizable considering when she joins the party in-game, but she functions just fine despite that. I gave her the Orichalcum R, to boost her stats higher as she doesn’t use that much SP. Her tier 3 skill Masquerade can replace Sword Dance.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"section section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Best accessories in general:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">SP Adhesive 3 (Takemi’s clinic at Rank 5, 50% discount at Rank 7)</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Shiny Belt R: Invigorate 3/All Stats +3 (Itemize Izanagi-no-Okami during an alarm, DLC)</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Ring of Envy: Auto-Concentrate/Masukukaja (Palace 6 Will Seed accessory)</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Ring of Greed: Attack Master/Concentrate (Palace 5 Will Seed accessory)</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Ring of Pride: Defense Master/Charge (Palace 7 Will Seed accessory)</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Pick-Me-Up Tie: Insta-Heal (1/15 Home Shopping Channel)</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Divine Pillar: Firm Stance (Beat the Reaper)</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Crystal Skull R: +6 All Stats &amp;

What you need are Ryuji’s Rank 7 ability Insta-Kill, Chihaya’s Rank 8 ability Celestial Reading and 20k Yen. Get Chihaya to raise the chances of a fusion alarm on a day you’re going to Mementos. Go into the first floor, and insta-kill 2–3 shadows to trigger an alarm. Go back to the Velvet Room, fuse any two Personas together, then use that new fused Persona (it’s name will be in yellow) to strengthen the one you want maxed stats on. The strengthening will not result in any XP gain, but you will get a total of +10 to random stats. You can keep doing this until all of a Persona’s stats are at 99.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Last thing: 3 of the Personas here are from the new DLC, but there’s plenty of great Personas in the base game/free legacy DLC, which are more than enough to complete any challenge the game throws at you (I cover some more at the end of this post). Optimizing Personas to this extent is mainly only useful for Super Bosses, otherwise you can basically use whoever you like and get through every Palace just fine.

Hassou Tobi is a top 3 damaging skill in the game, alongside Myriad Truths and Shining Arrows, and now can even be boosted by traits. The best trait to have on Yoshitsune is Undying Fury, originally from Zaou-Gongen, which raises the damage of Phys skills by 30%.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WUqPvRhI02U\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The only essential skills that are a must to have on Yoshitsune are Hassou Tobi and Arms Master. Otherwise, you can go with adding a bunch of Drain skills, making it so you only take damage from Gun and Almighty.

So, if you are planning to use him for Magic and want max damage, Mighty Gaze, Intense Focus or Will of the Sword are better (all are +20% and exceed the cap). While Satanael’s original trait doesn’t exceed the damage cap, his exclusive skill Tyrant’s Mind (1.25x boost to all attacks) can. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-5-royal-traits-faq-582a66c5c475\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-5-royal-traits-faq-582a66c5c475\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here’s a link to a Persona traits post if that was confusing.</a></p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WVHAf8tRm0E\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Given that info, there’s a number of different builds you could go for with Satanael. Excluding the new DLC, Satanael with Intense Focus or Will of the Sword and Black Viper provides the highest Almighty damage in the game.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Or you could go for a Gun build, because with Will of the Sword and Tyrant’s Mind, it provides the highest Gun damage possible. Another option is putting multiple elements on Satanael and adding Magic Ability. Pagan Allure, Magic Ability and Tyrant’s Mind would then give 2.34x damage (1.5*1.25*1.25).</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Arsene</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yVNssJiMj47NXiaZ-vkZYg.png\" data-image-id=\"1*yVNssJiMj47NXiaZ-vkZYg.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"811\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Have to keep the Starter around, and I wanted to replicate Arsene’s moveset from Persona Q2 and Persona 5 Scramble, being Curse and Gun-focused.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FnQ-OaqMHdA\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Here’s a video guide on building this type of Arsene.

The Vitality of the Tree trait (originally from Attis) lets you use Thermopylae (full party Heat Riser) in normal conditions, while the other skill slots were filled with Charge, Concentrate, Debilitate and Raoul’s exclusive skill Phantom Show (high chance of Sleep to all foes). To get Vitality of the Tree on Raoul, re-fuse him by using Attis and Agathion. Orpheus’ Neo Cadenza (see below) is better than Thermopylae, but is only available through the paid DLC, while Vitality of the Tree+Thermopylae can be transferred to any Persona you want.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Maria</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ufAD9dB66zTlM12VWjxBWA.png\" data-image-id=\"1*ufAD9dB66zTlM12VWjxBWA.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"810\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Maria has two exclusive passives, one being Holy Whisper which restores 15% HP and 15 SP every turn, and the other being Holy Embrace which restores 25% HP every turn.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SbsSsmlim-k\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you transfer the Demon’s Bite trait from Ongyo-Ki, which doubles own HP recovery, you can recover 80% HP per turn with Maria equipped. By adding the Regenerate 2 and 3 passives, it becomes 100% per turn. Instead of Regenerate 2 and 3, I opted to go with other passives like Ali Dance, Enduring Soul and Drain Fire, because 80% HP per turn is really more than enough.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Izanagi-no-Okami</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DFrkKNO9zgqt7CakpvIavA.png\" data-image-id=\"1*DFrkKNO9zgqt7CakpvIavA.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"810\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The strongest Persona available, for sure. Can one-shot the Reaper, one-shot most story bosses, even makes Super Bosses feel tame. Izanagi-nO has an exclusive trait called Country Maker, which increases Attack/Defense based on Inmate registry completion.

Then boosted again by Country Maker, giving you 4x. Needless to say, nothing much stands up to it. Atlus seems to love making DLC overpowered, but they <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">may</em> have gone a bit overboard here.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Orpheus</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vWKAgUIBO0HUcB9jjJFUzQ.png\" data-image-id=\"1*vWKAgUIBO0HUcB9jjJFUzQ.png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"449\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Orpheus’ exclusive skill Neo Cadenza heals 50% HP of the party, and also provides Heat Riser for the whole party, while only costing 24 SP.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5qFQuvocoac\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you pass down the Wealth of Lotus trait from Lakshmi, Neo Cadenza’s buffs will be extended by 2 turns.

Since you’re not able to change a trait after fusion, it’s pretty important to know how it actually works, because you don’t want to spend time maxing out stats on a Persona whose trait doesn’t function how you think it does. I wanted to make this post to clear some misconceptions, and I’ll keep it updated as I’m able to test more myself.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Related: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/ultimate-persona-team-persona-5-royal-builds-1ec9f2fee2b5\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/ultimate-persona-team-persona-5-royal-builds-1ec9f2fee2b5\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor\" title=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/ultimate-persona-team-persona-5-royal-builds-1ec9f2fee2b5\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong\">Ultimate Persona Team (Persona 5 Royal Builds).</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"section section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Are all traits transferable?</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">All traits can be passed on, except for DLC Persona traits.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">What is the chance rate of party member traits activating?</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pFRCZfkm6Ig2fAjH9lz8LA.jpeg\" data-image-id=\"1*pFRCZfkm6Ig2fAjH9lz8LA.jpeg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Some party members have traits that do not activate every time, and are instead chance based, such as Ryuji, Ann and Akechi. I tested how often their traits activated during Velvet Room challenge battles. Ryuji’s trait Raging Temper activated 12/60 times and Ann’s trait Mastery of Magic activated 6/30 times, so fair to say the chance rate on their traits is ~20%. Akechi’s trait Tactical Spirit (Chance to halve Support skill costs for all allies) activated 29/50 times, so his seems to activate at a ~60% rate.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Also, Izanagi has a trait named ‘God Maker’, which increases the chance of ally traits activating. When equipping Izanagi, Raging Temper activated 36/61 times, almost 60%, which means that God Maker seems to triple the chances of ally traits working. Tactical Spirit, with God Maker equipped, activated every time.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Does Pagan Allure exceed the damage cap?</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">One of the biggest causes of confusion seems to be Satanael’s original trait, Pagan Allure, whose in-game description reads, “Strengthens magic skills by 50%”. Before going further, it’s important to know how damage boosting works in P5. All damage boosts are multiplicative, so if you have something like Boost+Amp+Magic Ability, you would expect to have 2.34x damage (1.25*1.5*1.25). However, there is a damage cap that restricts damage boosting to 100%, meaning those 3 skills would at most give you a 2x damage buff.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The JP wiki upon release stated that Satanael’s trait does not exceed the 100% damage cap, so if you already have something like Boost+Amp+Magic Ability, Pagan Allure will not add any damage on top of that. Satanael’s trait was the only one mentioned that could not exceed the damage cap, while other traits such as Mighty Gaze/Intense Focus (Strengthen multi-target or single target magic by 20%) could.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BU2rzFARF-o\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Luckily, SodiumCat was able to test this out recently and posted their results on Youtube, I’d recommend watching the video to see for yourself.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The TLDW is that yes, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Pagan Allure does not exceed the damage cap</strong>, so if you already have Boost+Amp+Magic Ability you will not see any extra damage due to Pagan Allure. However, Mighty Gaze/Intense Focus/Will of the Sword do exceed the cap, so if you are making a Magic-based Persona, those traits would be better. Satanael’s trait seems to be the only one that has this damage cap restriction.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It should be noted here that although Satanael’s trait doesn’t exceed the damage cap, his exclusive skill Tyrant’s Mind (1.25x boost to all attacks) can.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">How does Will of the Sword work?</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TbwP08DUSrJoOzqdTrLwMA.jpeg\" data-image-id=\"1*TbwP08DUSrJoOzqdTrLwMA.jpeg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Another trait that has led to some confusion is Will of the Sword. Its in-game description reads, “Triples the effect of Charge/Concentrate.” Charge/Concentrate regularly make the next attack do 2.5x damage, so there was a question of whether Will of the Sword changes the multiplier to 3x or if it triples the effectiveness of Charge itself, causing the next attack to do 7.5x damage (3 * 2.5).</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*H1JcQKp3YFBz6Iy7QTihqQ.jpeg\" data-image-id=\"1*H1JcQKp3YFBz6Iy7QTihqQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Brave Blade</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I went about testing it with Futsunushi. Brave Blade with no Charge did 2693 damage on avg, while Charged Brave Blade did 8039 damage on avg. So Charge multiplied the attack by 3x, not 7.5x. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">This means Will of the Sword gives an effective 20% damage boost (3 / 2.5).</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Lemc5e3MkOJqFjmYD0f9kA.jpeg\" data-image-id=\"1*Lemc5e3MkOJqFjmYD0f9kA.jpeg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Charged Brave Blade with Will of the Sword (~3x dmg)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The second question is, does Will of the Sword need to be on the Persona who attacks or the buffer? To test this, I put Charge on Will of the Sword Futsunushi. Then looked at a different Persona, Siegfried, with a completely separate trait.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Siegfried when using Brave Blade did 2705 damage normally. When I used Charge on Futsunushi, then switched to Siegfried to attack, the damage was 6665. The Charge multiplier here was ~2.5x, meaning <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Will of the Sword only works when it is on the attacker, not the buffing Persona</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">That last thing is the weird bug with this trait. If you start a battle with a Will of the Sword Persona equipped, you will automatically have a free Concentrate on you. This was noted on the JP wiki as well. There’s nothing in the trait description that mentions this, so it can only be assumed to be a bug.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Do Striking Weight or Undying Fury affect Gun skills?</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Striking Weight and Undying Fury increase the damage of Phys skills by 20% or 30%. Since Gun skills are affected by Charge, it might have been the case that they would be affected by these traits. But no, if you use a gun skill with either of these traits, an activation message doesn’t show up in-game and there isn’t a damage difference.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">What are the best transferable damage boosting traits?</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Since we now know that Pagan Allure cannot exceed the damage cap, and that Will of the Sword gives a 3x boost not a 7.5x one, we can get a better idea of what the best transferable damage raising traits are. For boss fights:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">On Phys attackers, it would be Undying Fury (Strengthens Phys attacks by 30%, Zaou-Gongen).</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">On Gun attackers, it would be Will of the Sword (Futsunushi).</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">On Magic attackers, it would be Mighty Gaze, Intense Focus or Will of the Sword. Mighty Gaze/Intense Focus always give you +20%, but you have to choose between single and multi-target skills. Will of the Sword’s 20% boost only comes when concentrated, but allows for any type of skill to get the damage boost.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Since bosses are generally not susceptible to ailments, weakness hits or criticals, the guaranteed flat damage boost from the above traits would be best for those. For common enemies or Velvet Room challenges, there are other options such as:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Ailment Hunter: Raises damage dealt by 25% for each foe afflicted with an ailment</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Universal Law: Strengthens technical damage by 50% (Kohryu)</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Relentless: Strengthens attacks that strike foe weaknesses by 50% (this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKSIxAwnfUE\" data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKSIxAwnfUE\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">only works with single-target skills</a>)</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Linked Bloodline: Greatly increases damage after a Baton Pass (Cybele, some testing shows this trait only affects single-target skills after a Baton Pass, and the boost is 40%)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">How good is Country Maker?</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aSTPqfefozgsoh4RZqqx4A.jpeg\" data-image-id=\"1*aSTPqfefozgsoh4RZqqx4A.jpeg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">One of the new DLC Personas, Izanagi-no-Okami, has an exclusive trait called Country Maker, which “Increases Attack/Defense based on Inmate Registry completion.” The question is, how much of a damage/defense buff does it give, when compendium completion is 100%? As of right now, I have 91% Compendium completion, but that should be enough to see how much of a benefit Country Maker gives.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IvqJagpDw-vXDknOMyRJig.jpeg\" data-image-id=\"1*IvqJagpDw-vXDknOMyRJig.jpeg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For the Attack part, it can be tested by using a gun attack while Izanagi-nO is equipped, then equipping a different Persona with the same Str stat, doing the same attack and comparing the damage. A gun attack with Izanagi-nO equipped did 66 damage on avg, when equipping a different Persona, it did 34 damage on avg. This is a 1.94x damage boost, and considering I still have some space to fill in the compendium, it seems that Country Maker does indeed give a 100% damage boost to attacks at full capacity (and this can stack with other passives such as Boost/Amp/Magic Ability).</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5lpiXrMzkns3md7BCcWsAQ.jpeg\" data-image-id=\"1*5lpiXrMzkns3md7BCcWsAQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Defense can be looked at the same way. With Izanagi-nO equipped, Blazing Hell during a Velvet Room challenge did 50 damage on avg. Izanagi-nO has a resistance to fire and had the Firm Stance skill on him, so if neither of those were there, it would have done 200 damage.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fB5tOWQdRRogfG5Mkbc90g.jpeg\" data-image-id=\"1*fB5tOWQdRRogfG5Mkbc90g.jpeg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">On another Persona, with the same En stat but no Firm Stance and no resistance to fire, Blazing Hell did 360 damage on avg. So it seems Country Maker reduced damage taken here by 45% (1 - 200/360). Considering I currently have 91% compendium completion, it makes sense to draw the conclusion that Country Maker reduces damage taken by half when the compendium is fully completed.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">So in conclusion, with full compendium, Country Maker doubles your damage and reduces damage taken by half.</strong></p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Does Inviolable Beauty work with Repel Phys?</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZSj9A2Ao-2KvV6vW7SlZOQ.jpeg\" data-image-id=\"1*ZSj9A2Ao-2KvV6vW7SlZOQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"680\" data-height=\"383\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Repel Phys without Inviolable Beauty</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Kaguya naturally comes with a trait called Inviolable Beauty, whose description reads, “Triples damage dealt by Counter skills.” Because Kaguya learns both Counterstrike/High Counter and Repel Phys through level up, it was unclear whether Inviolable Beauty would work with Repel Phys, or if it only worked with designated ‘Counter’ skills.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k9np8gqwTm56tD_Ka0HIDA.jpeg\" data-image-id=\"1*k9np8gqwTm56tD_Ka0HIDA.jpeg\" data-width=\"680\" data-height=\"383\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Repel Phys with Inviolable Beauty (doing 3x damage)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Tested in the Velvet Room, Inviolable Beauty does in fact work with Repel Phys.

Dunno if that was intended, or if it is a bug.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Does the Omen trait boost the chances of Thanatos’ Door Of Hades?</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*igUs7vieE51AMCuNisSg7A.jpeg\" data-image-id=\"1*igUs7vieE51AMCuNisSg7A.jpeg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Thanatos’ exclusive skill is Door of Hades, whose description reads, “Heavy Almighty damage to all foes with medium chance of instant death.” Sandalphon’s original trait is Omen, which “Greatly increases the chance of insta-kills.” It would be interesting to look at if Omen boosts Door of Hades’ instant death chances.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Iqy6Gb2m5FKlfhFjP14Irg.jpeg\" data-image-id=\"1*Iqy6Gb2m5FKlfhFjP14Irg.jpeg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">To test, I first used Door of Hades, with Thanatos’ original trait, on Nebiros in one of the Velvet Room challenges. Door of Hades resulted in an instant death 15/45 times (33%). I then re-fused Thanatos to put the Omen trait on him, and tested it out again with the new trait. Omen Door of Hades then resulted in an instant death 29/60 times (48%). <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Omen gave a ~1.5x boost to the chance of Door of Hades succeeding, so it’s definitely worth it to have on Thanatos.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">One other thing that came out of this testing: the Alice in the Velvet Room challenge was programmed to block insta-deaths (Samsara was blocked on her). But both Nebiros and Belial could be taken out with Samsara, meaning they’re both vulnerable to insta-kills. However, during all the times I tried Door of Hades, it never worked on Belial. Then I saw later that Belial nulls curse skills. So from doing this, I think it confirms that Door of Hades deals Almighty damage, but it’s insta-death component is Curse-based. So perhaps Mudo Boost could also raise Door of Hades’ chances. And given that Nebiros resists curse, it’s likely that Omen Door of Hades has a higher chance rate than 48% against a curse neutral foe.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Would Foul Stench be useful with Raoul’s Phantom Show?</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tCgGdUHf-Qv1FLekAqby0Q.jpeg\" data-image-id=\"1*tCgGdUHf-Qv1FLekAqby0Q.jpeg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Foul Stench Raoul for testing</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Since Raoul’s exclusive skill is Phantom Show (High odds of sleep to all foes), it makes sense to try and increase the chances of it connecting as much as possible. The Foul Stench trait and Ailment Boost skill have the same in-game description, “Increases chance of inflicting ailments.” I wondered if there would be any difference between having both of these on Raoul, versus only having one.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">So I tested a Raoul with the Foul Stench trait + Ailment Boost skill, against one that only had Ailment Boost. With Foul Stench + Ailment Boost, Phantom Show connected 99/102 times (97%). With only Ailment Boost, Phantom Show actually connected more, 101/102 times (99%). Functionally the exact same hit rate, despite not having the Foul Stench trait. So it seems having both is not worth it if you are using Phantom Show, you can simply have Ailment Boost and choose another trait for Raoul.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you are making a separate Ailment Persona, Foul Stench+Ailment Boost could be useful for skills like Evil Smile/Wage War/etc., which have medium odds instead of the high odds of Phantom Show.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>",

I just wanted to have a post to showcase the team I had on my NG+ run and explain the reasons I chose the specific Personas/skills.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">I should note that each Persona on this team is massively overkill. If you just want to enjoy the game, you can use almost any high level Persona and finish the story, even on the hardest difficulty. I simply made these Personas because optimizing them interested me, and cause I wanted to do a solo Joker Merciless run. This type of team is more than enough to solo the Reaper, Final Boss, and Secret Boss on Merciless without too much trouble. It should also be noted that strengthening up Personas to Level 99 requires a lot of in-game money and quite a bit of real world time. A guide of how to min-max Personas can be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmHqcVsaN8k\" data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmHqcVsaN8k\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found here</a> and a guide of how to money farm can be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDI26iyW_Vg\" data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDI26iyW_Vg\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found here</a>. A fusion calculator with all Personas and skill descriptions can be <a href=\"https://chinhodado.github.io/persona5_calculator/index.html#/list\" data-href=\"https://chinhodado.github.io/persona5_calculator/index.html#/list\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found here</a>. One thing I had to go back and change here: Ali Dance and Angelic Grace don’t stack (the one skill with the highest effect will activate when attacked), so I fixed having both on some Personas.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Last preamble: The stats of the Personas in game are 10–12 points higher than their base stats, due to Joker’s melee weapon (Pro-Parrying Dagger En/Ag +2), ranged weapon (Nataraja All Stats +5) and accessory (Crystal Skull All Stats +5/High Magic Evasion).</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Satanael</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mRJ1y14UiF_t-FF_30brsQ.png\" data-image-id=\"1*mRJ1y14UiF_t-FF_30brsQ.png\" data-width=\"1400\" data-height=\"782\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Having a Persona which can start the battle off with the 3 Auto-Ma skills is very useful, giving your whole party a free Heat Riser. I also included the 3 Regenerate skills, so if I ever needed to use an SP recovery item, I could equip this Persona, take very little damage and heal 12% HP. As badass as Satanael looks, he unfortunately is not very good as a damage dealer, due to starting out at Level 95, pretty much at the level cap. This means his stats can’t be min-maxed to reach 99 in Strength or Magic. However, given all his resistances, he works very well as a defensive, recovery Persona.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Yoshitsune</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NCsM0otUTYSz6L4Wd-F3DQ.png\" data-image-id=\"1*NCsM0otUTYSz6L4Wd-F3DQ.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"808\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Of course this team would have Yoshitsune, arguably the most broken Persona in the game. Hassou Tobi (8 times light Physical damage to all foes) is the highest damage dealing skill in the game on average, and it doesn’t even require any boosts/amps, allowing for more skill slots to use however you choose.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Arms Master is a must for halving the cost of Hassou Tobi. Ali Dance pairs well with Crystal Skull, giving you a very high evasion rate. Sharp Student lowers the chance of getting hit with a critical, Insta-Heal negates ailments, Enduring Soul effectively gives you an extra life, Regen 3 heals 6% per turn and Repel Curse is there to block those pesky Mudo skills.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Kaguya</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SI_pjjtgcjGFQRA4XbUCPg.png\" data-image-id=\"1*SI_pjjtgcjGFQRA4XbUCPg.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"810\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Kaguya is basically the Magic-based counterpart for Yoshitsune. Her exclusive skill Shining Arrows deals 4 to 8 times light Bless damage to all foes, and can be further strengthened with Bless Boost/Amp and Magic Ability. If Shining Arrows only hits 4 times, it does as much damage as a similarly boosted Black Viper (the strongest Almighty skill), if it hits 6 times it does about as much as Hassou Tobi, and if it hits 7–8 times, it does 10–25% more than Hassou Tobi.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Arsene</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iAOxyJIIOtvWK1XuEOqumw.png\" data-image-id=\"1*iAOxyJIIOtvWK1XuEOqumw.png\" data-width=\"1400\" data-height=\"785\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The legend himself, Arsene makes a lot of sense as a Gun build, because he starts at Level 1, meaning he has the most stats left to distribute into Strength, Endurance, Agility and Luck of any Persona. I wanted to get the highest crit chance possible with him so I levelled the Luck stat to 99. This Persona is basically there to crit every common enemy and mini-boss, not as much for long boss battles, so Victory Cry is there instead of Arms Master. For enemies normal to Gun attacks, One-Shot Kill crits every time and Riot Gun crits 50–60% of the time. Riot Gun is also one of the highest damaging skills besides Hassou Tobi/Shining Arrows, so a Gun Build is pretty worth it to make.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Izanagi</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TEkFU5qVH2bQjs29Ia5TUA.png\" data-image-id=\"1*TEkFU5qVH2bQjs29Ia5TUA.png\" data-width=\"1400\" data-height=\"785\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">An Almighty user is pretty much mandatory if you want to beat the Reaper (at least when you are very low-levelled in comparison), since the Reaper resists everything but Almighty attacks, so I chose Izanagi for this role. So one Almighty skill, along with Almighty Boost/Amp, Magic Ability and Spell Master were obvious additions. The Reaper likes to use One-Shot Kill and Riot Gun a lot, so Enduring Soul is there in case I get hit with a critical. Megidoloan is the Almighty skill of choice over Black Viper, because although Black Viper does slightly more damage, it costs 10 SP more per use and is only single target, so Megidoloan is overall the better skill to have.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Messiah</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kuY8F4ZpxBTxnQV9buEG9w.png\" data-image-id=\"1*kuY8F4ZpxBTxnQV9buEG9w.png\" data-width=\"1400\" data-height=\"785\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">At first glance, as a Healer, this build might look off because it only has one healing skill, and it’s single target, but Messiah was built with a solo Joker run in mind, so Mediarahan/Salvation isn’t needed and revival skills wouldn’t be possible either. I chose Messiah as the healer because of his natural resistances, which with Firm Stance and max Endurance, allow him to take minuscule damage.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Rangda &amp; Girimehkala</h4>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HdtK-p0WDAbXVzlbXNrW7w.png\" data-image-id=\"1*HdtK-p0WDAbXVzlbXNrW7w.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"808\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oCn9C8t39tAgC9jVtnJ2Og.png\" data-image-id=\"1*oCn9C8t39tAgC9jVtnJ2Og.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"808\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Rangda and Girimehkala both repel physical and gun, which is important because those types of attacks can crit, and a crit versus the Secret Boss or Reaper is a game over. There are no skills that Null/Absorb/Repel Gun attacks, so having a Persona with a natural resistance is good to have. Rangda and Girimehkala are some of the few that negate Physical/Gun naturally, and they both do not have that many weaknesses to patch up either.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Thus, Concentrate/Debilitate as the Support skills, Spell Master to halve SP cost, Insta-Heal for ailments, Ali Dance for evasion and two skills to cover weaknesses. All of the reasons I use Girimehkala are mentioned with Rangda, and he has the same skills except Charge/Heat Riser instead.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"section section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">Bonus: Party Awakened Personas (Level 99 Stats and Move Set)</h4>\n<div class=\"graf graf--mixtapeEmbed\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-5-royal-party-member-builds-7505384717de\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-5-royal-party-member-builds-7505384717de\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor\" title=\"https://medium.com/@bainz350/persona-5-royal-party-member-builds-7505384717de\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong\">Persona 5 Royal Party Member Builds</strong></a></div>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NovSira6ANeKP7lt7DPzjw.png\" data-image-id=\"1*NovSira6ANeKP7lt7DPzjw.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"807\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Morgana</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eQYlpItPKeI-NK-A-MMTOQ.png\" data-image-id=\"1*eQYlpItPKeI-NK-A-MMTOQ.png\" data-width=\"1440\" data-height=\"807\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Ryuji.
